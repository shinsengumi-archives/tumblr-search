KONDO (\u00e8\u00bf\u0091\u00e8\u0097\u00a4\u00e5\u008b\u0087) [wiki-corpus] Isami KONDO (November 9, 1834 - May 17, 1868) was the head of the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He served as a shogunate retainer in his later years. Isami was his nickname, and his real name was Masayoshi. His family crest was the Marunimitsubiki (a circle with three straight parallel lines laid horizontally inside). Joining the Shieikan Dojo He was born the third son of a farmer called Kyujiro MIYAGAWA. His childhood name was Katsugoro. In addition to Katsugoro, the Miyagawa family included a daughter Rie (who died two years before Isami KONDO\u2019s birth), the oldest son Otogoro MIYAGAWA, and the second son Kumejiro MIYAGAWA. He was from Kamiishihara Village, Tama district, Musashi Province, which is currently (in the northwestern part of) Nomizu, Chofu City, Tokyo. His birthplace was torn down in the Chofu Airport expansion work during the war. On December 6, 1849, Kondo joined the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing dojo (hall used for martial arts training) called the Shieikan Dojo. He was recognized by Shusuke KONDO (Shusai KONDO) for killing thieves, and this led him to become an adopted son of the Shimazaki family where Shusuke was from, and he then called himself Katsuta SHIMAZAKI. Afterwards, he was officially adopted by the Kondo family; therefore, he first called himself Isami SHIMAZAKI but later began calling himself Isami KONDO. In 1860, he married Tsune MATSUI, the oldest daughter of Yasogoro MATSUI, who was serving the Shimizu family. In September of the next year, he had an exhibition match at the Okunitama-jinja Shrine in Fuchu City, Tokyo, to announce his succession as the fourth head of the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing originator family, and as he officially became the successor of the family, he became heavily responsible for it. In 1862, his first daughter, Tama KONDO, was born. In 1863, accepting Hachiro KIYOKAWA\u2019s suggestion, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) recruited participants of the \u2018Roshigumi (Ronin Corps),\u2019 which was an organization consisting of ronin, or lordless samurai, for guarding the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA on the way to the capital. The eight members of the Shieikan Dojo other than Hajime SAITO decided to join, and on March 26, they left for Kyoto with other Roshigumi members. The party arrived in Kyoto on April 10 after proceeding down Nakasendo Road, and Mibugoshi (Mibu samurai) Gennojo YAGI kindly let them stay at his residence. Becoming the head of Shinsengumi Kiyokawa suggested to the Imperial Court that the Roshigumi return to Edo (the old name of Tokyo), by submitting a petition. 24 members, including Kondo and Kamo SERIZAWA, who was a samurai from the Mito domain, opposed the idea of returning to Edo remained in Kyoto. He submitted a petition to Katamori MATSUDAIRA, who was the head of the Aizu domain in the Kyoto Shugo Shoku post (the deputy of Kyoto), such that they could call themselves the 'Mibu Roshigumi\u2019 and start their own activities under the control of the Kyoto Shugo Shoku. Mibu Roshigumi did not operate smoothly after its establishment, and on May 12, one of the initial members of Mibu Roshigumi, Yoshio TONOUCHI, died there (there has been an assassination theory). Members of the Yuzan NEGISHI faction and Shingoro KASUYA left the organization, Eizaburo ABIRU died of illness (there has been an assassination theory), and Jiro IESATO killed himself. As a result, Mibu Roshigumi consisted of two factions, the Kondo and Serizawa factions. When the coup of August 18 led by Imperial prince Nakagawa no miya Asahiko, the Aizu domain, and the Satsuma domain occurred for the purpose of removing the Choshu domain from the politics in Kyoto, Mibu Roshigumi was appointed to guard the Ohanabatake-mon Gate. Their performance was then recognized and the organization was given a new troop name of 'Shinsengumi\u2019 by the Buketenso (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the court). When the members of the Serizawa factions were assassinated on October 28 (or 30) of the same year, a new organization system was established under the leadership of Isami KONDO. In July, 1864, Shinsengumi captured Shuntaro FURUTAKA who was an ally of Teizo MIYABE of the Kumamoto domain. Knowing from the statement of Shuntaro FURUTAKA that there was a plan to set fire to the Nakagawanomiya-tei Imperial house, the Shinsengumi immediately started to search for the Miyabe faction, committed the Ikedaya Incident, and destroyed the faction. For this, Shinsengumi received a commendation and an award from both the Imperial Court and the bakufu. After fighting in the Kinmon Incident, Isami KONDO returned home to recruit new members. He then successfully recruited new members, including Kashitaro ITO. In 1865, he left for Hiroshima to serve as Naoyuki NAGAI\u2019s squire. In 1867, the entire Shinsengumi became a shogunate vassal, and Isami KONDO held rank as the vassal with the privilege to have an audience with the shogun. This promotion allowed Isami KONDO to carry out negotiations with important individuals as one of the bakufu representatives, and Shojiro GOTO, who was a politician from the Tosa domain, was one of the examples. Meanwhile, Kashitaro ITO parted from the organization as a Goryo Eji (Guard of an Emperor\u2019s Tomb), in which Heisuke TODO and Hajime SAITO (a spy belonging to the Kondo faction) also joined. Ito planned to assassinate Kondo (there has been a theory however that Ito never thought about assassinating Kondo), but instead, on December 13 of the same year, Kondo made Ito drunk and ordered Kuwajiro OISHI to assassinate Ito on his way home. Then, he invited other Goryo Eji out, made a nighttime assault on them, and killed Todo and others. In retaliation for that assault, Kondo was shot and injured by the remaining members of Goryo Eji on Fushimi-kaido Road on January 12, 1868. He therefore could not lead the troop in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 27, 1868, and healed himself in Osaka-jo Castle. Ryojun MATSUMOTO, who was a bakufu teni (bakufu doctor) as well as a medical examiner of Shinsengumi, treated Kondo. The Boshin War The Shinsengumi returned to Edo by a bakufu battleship after losing the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. When he visited Ryojun MATSUMOTO at his residence after returning to Edo, a photographer, Kuichi UCHIDA, who happened to be there took pictures of him and two of them still exist. It is said that in one of the pictures he leaned a little bit because his right shoulder had been injured. In March, following the bakufu order, Kondo renamed himself Takeshi OKUBO, restructured the troop as the Koyo Chinbutai troop, and led the troop to Kofu for service, but the troop lost to the new government force in the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma and he was routed, and at the same time, Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Sanosuke HARADA left the troop because of conflicts of opinion. He then renamed himself again, taking the name Yamato OKUBO, recruited former bakufu infantry in the Goheishinden district (currently Adachi Ward, Tokyo), and met them in the Nagareyama District, Shimosa Province (currently Nagareyama City, Chiba Prefecture) in April; however, they were surrounded by the new government force and he surrendered to the government force headquarters in the Koshigaya District (currently Koshigaya City, Saitama Prefecture). Someone in the government force knew that Okubo used to be Kondo; therefore, he was taken to Itabashi-shuku (the first shukuba (inn town) from Edo on Nakasendo Road) where the government-general office was. Although Kondo insisted that he was Okubo, Washio KANO, a former Shinsengumi member as well as one of the Goryo Eji, found that he really was Kondo, and this led to him being captured. Then, there was a disagreement between the Tosa and Satsuma domains over how Kondo should be treated, but in the end, on May 17, he was beheaded at the Hiraoichirizuka mound (currently the Takino-gawa River, Kita Ward, Tokyo). He was 35 years old. His head was exhibited in Itabashi, the Sennichimae area in Osaka, and the Sanjo-gawara Riverside in Kyoto. It is not certain where the head went afterwards. Grave It has been believed that the high priest of the Higashi-Hongan-ji Temple received and buried Kondo\u2019s remains, but there is another theory that his comrades took the body back and buried it at Hozo-ji Temple in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, and there is in fact a mound for Kondo\u2019s head at this temple. There are also his graves built by his former comrade Shinpachi NAGAKURA at the Ryugen-ji Temple in Mitaka City, Tokyo (quite close to the present Nomizu, Chofu City, where he was from as described above) and in front of the JR Itabashi Station which is close to an execution ground. There is a grave at the Tennei-ji Temple in Aizuwakamatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture, where part of his body was supposedly buried by Toshizo HIJIKATA, and there is also a grave at the Kokoku-ji Temple in Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, where a cousin of Isami KONDO, Kintaro KONDO, is reported to have secretly taken the head back and buried it. In Nagareyama City and Aizuwakamatsu City, the 'Anniversary for Isami KONDO\u2019s Death\u2019 is celebrated every year for his soul. His descendents in Tokyo have been farmers for generations, and the present descendents are also farmers there. Also, one of his descendents, Seizo MIYAGAWA, became the ninth head of the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing originator family (Isami KONDO was the fourth head). His posthumous Buddhist name was Kantenindenjungiseichudaikoji. His words of wisdom He was featured in the NHK historical drama 'Shinsengumi!\u2019 by Japan Broadcasting Corporation. The source of the statement below about the poor insight was \u2019 \u2019 of the Shusui edition of \u201cSoshi\u201d written by Soshi, and the source of the highlighted part is unknown. The frog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean. But it knows the height of the sky.

The name (currently unavailable) contained the elements \u201cinden\u201d\nand \u201cdaikoji\u201d, which are usually reserved for the social elite. Because he was originally a farmer,\nKondo normally would not have qualified for such a name and so it was a huge honor.

[November 9, 1834 in Kamiishihara, Chofu, Tokyo.] Died - April 25, 1868 in Itabashi, Musashi at age 35. [May 17, 1868 in Itabashi, Tokyo at age 34.] Names - Imina - Masanobu (Masayoshi) Childhood Name - Miyagawa Katsugoro Alternate Name - Okubo Yamato Kondo briefly took the name \u201cOkubo Yamato\u201d on March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868] when he was made a Junior Councilor. It was the name he was using at the time the imperial army arrested him. Matsudaira Katamori created a \u201ckaimyo\u201d or \u201cBuddhist death name\u201d for him at the time Hijikata built a grave for him in Aizu. The name (currently unavailable) contained the elements \u201cinden\u201d and \u201cdaikoji\u201d, which are usually reserved for the social elite. Because he was originally a farmer, Kondo normally would not have qualified for such a name and so it was a huge honor. It can be considered a small example of Matsudaira\u2019s thankfulness to the Shinsengumi for their long years of support. Physical Description - It is said that Kondo had a \u201crustic\u201d face, but was still attractive enough that women surrounded him. He is also noted to have dimples when he would smile. His mouth was very wide and his entire fist could be fit inside. He had a very powerful build and a sharp gaze. Although there is not an exact estimate of his height, he was not an extremely tall man. Rumor has it that his topknot only came even with Hijikata\u2019s chin if they stood next to each other. Personality Quirks and Traits - Kondo seems to have enjoyed entertaining others by showing them how he could put his fist in his mouth. He was also said to have pulled the same trick with his favorite food, manju (steamed dumpling). In personality he was a simple, honest man of traditional values. Many noted his kindness and generosity. No one ever saw Kondo drunk. He often borrowed books from Kojima Shikanosuke while he was still in Tama and he spent much of his spare time reading in the final days before his arrest. As a leader he was a capable man who had a sense of authority about him and a rather martial attitude. He was always very serious when on duty, though he could be very friendly at other times. Although he was a good person overall, Kondo sometimes took too much pride in the Shinsengumi\u2019s success. Even Hijikata warned him about this on occasion. There were some who accused him of being arrogant and things got so bad at one point that Nagakura Shinpachi led others in filing a petition to Aizu against him. Whatever tensions may have existed between himself and the rest of the Shinsengumi however, Kondo was always well respected by them and they honored his memory after his death. Family History - Kondo was the third son of a powerful farmer named Miyagawa Kyujiro. His mother, Miyo, passed away when he was only about four or five. She seems to have been only around 38 at the time. He had two older brothers and the eldest was named Otogoro. He also appears to have had both an older and younger sister, but both of them died very young. Incidently, the Miyagawa house is no longer standing. It was demolished during World War II (1943) so that a nearby military airbase could extend their runways. On October 19, 1849 [December 8, 1849], he was adopted by Kondo Shusuke at the age of 16 [15]. Shusuke\u2019s wife was named Fude. According to some stories, Kondo met several women before he took a wife. He supposedly choose the first woman with an appearance that was not very good. His reason was said to have been that a beautiful woman would be a nuisance around the dojo because she would be a distraction to the men. Of course another story has it that he was forced to marry. He married Matsui Tsune on March 29, 1860 [April 19, 1860] at age 27 [26]. She was the eldest daughter of Matsui Yasogora, a vassal of a Hitotsubashi house who served a man named Shimizu. Their only child was a daughter named Tamako (or Tama according to some), who was born in 1862. Kondo was good friends with another Tama resident named Kojima Shikanosuke. Just before he left for Kyoto, the two became sworn brothers. His nephew, Miyagawa Yugoro, later followed him into the Shinsengumi. Yugoro was his elder brother\u2019s son. After Kondo was executed, Yugoro is thought to have retrieved his body for proper burial. Later on he married Tamako, taking on the Kondo name and inheriting his uncle\u2019s dojo. Unfortunately the couple had no children and Tamako died of illness while still very young. Yugoro later remarried. Another nephew, Miyagawa Shinkichi, joined the Shinsengumi in 1865 when they came to recruit in the Edo area. He died in action at Tenma-ya and is buried at the same temple as Kondo. Kondo\u2019s brother-in-law, Matsui Tokutaro, may have also been in the group. Before the Shinsengumi - Kondo is described as having been a good kid who did not need to be scolded very often. His father was a lover of war tales and often told him heroic stories that would later have a profound influence on how he conducted the Shinsengumi. He apparently had trouble with some of the older kids every once in a while. One story has it that he took revenge on someone who was harassing him by climbing a tree, then peeing on the person when he passed underneath. On another occasion two youths tried to bully him, but they gave up in disgust when they could not force him to cry. Kondo himself was never cruel to younger children and when he would steal persimmons he would divide any leftovers up among them. Sometime after joining the Shieikan, an intruder broke into the Miyagawa home and tried to take some valuable item. Kondo took the lead even though he was the youngest. The brothers ambushed the thief when he was on his way out and caused him to drop the object he was trying to steal. When his brother would have gone in pursuit of the man, Kondo stopped him by pointing out that they had the item back and pursuit would be dangerous. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Tennen Rishin Ryu Shihan (Teacher) Teacher - Kondo Shusuke, Shieikan dojo [Ichigaya, Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo] Along with his two brothers, Kondo became a disciple of Tennen Rishin Ryu on November 11, 1848 [December 6, 1848] at age 15 [14]. He was very enthusiastic about practicing and learned quickly. Kondo Shusuke soon noted both his skill and temperament. After hearing about the incident with the thief from their father, Shusuke was sufficiently impressed to make the boy his successor. Miyagawa Katsugoro was adopted into the Kondo family on October 19, 1849 and took the name Kondo Isami. By August 27, 1861 [October 1, 1861] a field match was held at Yasaka Shrine to celebrate his succession to the head of the Shieikan dojo, making him the fourth generation master of the school. Teaching had never been limited to just the dojo. Kondo traveled throughout the countryside to give lessons. Both Kojima Shikanosuke and Sato Hikogoro had dojo in their homes for this purpose and it was on one of these visits that he first met Hijikata Toshizo. The two soon formed a friendship that would last for the rest of their lives. Swordsmanship was not the only thing taught at the Shieikan. Kojima Shikanosuke was known to come there to teach calligraphy to the students. There also seems to be mention of spear and jujutsu being taught as well. Kondo had a black training robe with a human skull embroidered in white on the back. It was said he wore this to show his determination as a swordsman. The jacket is now on display at the Kojima house. His favorite technique was called \u201cRyubi no Ken\u201d. (\u201cA dragon attacks with his tail when his head is attacked and attacks with his head when his tail is attacked.\u201d) When an opponent raised his sword in the \u201cjodan\u201d stance (an offensive position), Kondo would lower the tip of his in the \u201cgedan\u201d stance (a defensive position with the sword point toward the other person\u2019s knees) and turn his body to stay in \u201chanmi\u201d (a position where the body is turned sideways in relation to the foe\u2019s). When his opponent attacked, he would quickly raise his own sword to either break the other person\u2019s blade or deflect the slash, then use the same momentum to immediately inflict a downwards stroke while they were unprotected. His Sword(s)- Long Sword - Nagasone Kotetsu - 2'3\"5 Legend has it that Kondo owned a blade made by Kotetsu, one of the thirty-one greatest swordsmiths, who lived during the 17 th century. The story goes that he stopped a robber at the famous Konoike shop in Osaka. In gratitude, the owner gave the sword to Kondo as a gift. However Kotetsu\u2019s blades were sought after because they were known to perform well in \u201ctameshigiri\u201d tests. This was a process where cutting ability was tested on a human corpse, usually a criminal\u2019s. The results would be inscribed onto the blade, but these could easily be forged. And even during Kotetsu\u2019s lifetime people were making swords that they then attributed to him in order to charge a higher price. According to Saito Hajime, Kondo\u2019s sword was just such a forgery. As he told others years later, he himself had bought the blade at a secondhand shop called the Yotsuya because Kondo thought it resembled a Kotetsu. Saito gave it to him in order to thank him for lessons that he had received at the Shieikan, which incidently confirms that he was associated with the group long before they went to Kyoto. Even though he was well aware from the start that it was a fake, Kondo was very happy with the sword. As Saito described it, the blade had some sort of sculpture on the guard. There was also some sort of inscription (possibly a forged tameshigiri result) which had long before worn away. There are a few who say that Kondo owned another sword called the Kiyomaru. This swordsmith was making blades around the time of the Bakumatsu. Shinsengumi Years - Was one of three Commanders of the \u201cMibu Roshi\u201d when the group first formed in Mibu. Later he became the sole Commander of the group when Serizawa Kamo and others were eliminated. He had originally joined the \u201cRoshitai\u201d in hopes of becoming a samurai in the service of the Shogun. This wish came true in June of 1867 when the Shinsengumi became direct retainers of the Tokugawa. Kondo himself had the right to directly meet with the Shogun. On March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868] he was appointed to the \u201cWakatoshiyori\u201d or \u201cJunior Council\u201d, which administered the Tokugawa\u2019s personal domains. It was on this occasion that he was given the name \u201cOkubo Yamato\u201d. Unfortunately his success came only when the shogunate was already crumbling. Kondo had been injured in December of 1867 when the remaining followers of Ito Kashitaro made an attempt on his life. The wound was in his right shoulder and continued to plague him for the few remaining months of his life. After Toba-Fushimi, he visited Matsumoto Ryojun in Edo and the doctor removed bone fragments which were still in the wound a month later. When he went to Kofu he had to travel in a palanquin and could not raise his arm above chest level. Following the battle, Hijikata had to rush him back to Edo for medical treatment because the injury had taken a turn for the worse. This proved to be a contributing factor in the falling out he had with Nagakura and Harada, since many of the group were angry they could not find their leader in a time of crisis and the two men had been forced to take steps to calm everyone down. He was captured on April 3, 1868 [April 25, 1868] and taken to Itabashi. A short time later, on April 25, 1868 [May 17, 1868], he was beheaded as a common criminal rather than being allowed to commit seppuku. He faced his death with great dignity and courage. His head was placed on public display in Edo. On April 8, 1868 [May 29, 1868] his head was taken to Kyoto and displayed at the Sanjo bridge. (No that is not a mistype. The lunar calendar sometimes required that a month be repeated in order to keep it in synch with the solar year.) Today the exact location of Kondo\u2019s remains are unknown and only a rough guess can be made. His body is most likely buried at Ryugen-ji temple in Mitaka, Tokyo by Miyagawa Yugoro, who was said to have bribed someone into letting him claim the body. His head was probably removed to Hozo-ji temple in Kyoto. However the truth is not known for certain. Love Life - Aside from his wife, Kondo is known to have kept at least four mistresses. The most famous of these was Miyuki, who had previously been a courtesan in Kyoto. His relationship with her seems to have begun sometime before Ikeda-ya and to have continued throughout the years the Shinsengumi were in the capitol. There\u2019s a story which claims that Kondo was interested in a geisha who turned out to be a supporter of the Shishi. This woman apparently made an offer to be his if he would support their cause, but he refused her and broke off the relationship. Early influences - As previously mentioned, Kondo\u2019s father frequently told him stories which had a great influence on him later in life. One of the people that he told him about was Kato Kiyomasa, who had played a prominent role in Toyotomi Hideyoshi\u2019s invasion of Korea. After Toyotomi\u2019s death, he seems to have given his support to Tokugawa Ieyasu in the political disputes which led up to Sekigahara. Kato wrote down a great many of his insights and viewpoints, but very little of this has ever been translated into English. Kondo also heard two of the four great Chinese classics from his father. One of these was called \u201cWater Margin\u201d or \u201cOutlaws of the Marsh\u201d. It seems to have been written by two men, Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai\u2019an. The novel is the story of Sung Chiang and his 36 companions, though the book increases the number to 108. Sung Chiang was a real bandit and his men had their base at Mount Liang around 1119. He is now a folk hero similar to Robin Hood. In an eerie parallel to what would become of the Shinsengumi, he and all of his followers were either killed by the government or chose to kill themselves. Brotherhood and defiance of authority are major themes in the book. Also interesting is that the bandits drew members from all walks of life. The other work was also by Luo Guanzhong and is called \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d. Apparently Kondo\u2019s favorite character was from this story and was someone that his father would insist was still alive. Unfortunately the part which spoke about this person was not very clear, but it could have possibly been referring to Guan Yu, who was a general in the army of Liu Bei and a very popular warrior. Legend claims he was nine feet tall with a red face and he owned a great steed named Red Hare. He was noted for his loyalty and righteousness, but was also accused of being arrogant. In yet another eerie parallel, he was eventually captured by the enemy and executed. Soon after his death, Guan Yu was deified and has been said to manifest himself from time to time in order to help with certain tasks, which could explain why Kondo\u2019s father would insist that the person was \u201cstill alive\u201d.

(\u00e5\u00b1\u00b1\u00e5\u008d\u0097\u00e6\u0095\u00ac\u00e5\u008a\u00a9) [wiki-corpus] Keisuke SANNAN (1833 - March 20, 1865) was the chief (vice chief) of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was from the Sendai Domain of Mutsu Province (later Rikuzen Province). Another way of reading his last name was \u2018Yamanami,\u2019 but he signed his name as '\u4e09\u5357 (Sannan)\u2019 and '\u4e09\u7537 (Sannan),\u2019 so it was highly likely that his last name was pronounced 'Sannan.\u2019 He called himself Saburo SANNAN in his old age. He excelled in both the literary and military arts and was an educated and warm person. He became known to people as 'Sannan-san.\u2019 Place of origin It was supposed that he left the Sendai Domain and went to Edo, but his last name of '\u5c71\u5357 (Sannan)\u2019 or '\u4e09\u5357 (Sannan)\u2019 does not exist in Sendai, so this fact is unknown. On the Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency) in Ono School Ittoryu (swordplay tradition), he later became a student of Shusaku Chiba of Hokushin Ittoryu. Shieikan He challenged other schools of Tennenrishinryu Swordplay Shieikan of Isami KONDO and defeated the opposing Kondo. At this time, he admired Kondo\u2019s skill and personality and began to respect Kondo. After that, he carried out activities with Kondo as well as the students in Shieikan. Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, and Shinpachi NAGAKURA joined the Shieikan who would later be the top officials in Shinsengumi. In September 1861, he joined the nojiai (game) as the Red Army for Isami KONDO to announce the appointment of the fourth head of Tennenrishinryu. At New Year\u2019s in 1862, he traveled to Onoji to instruct swordplay with Soji OKITA. Shinsengumi In March 1863, he joined roshi-gumi (an organization of masterless samurai) that was suggested by Hachiro KIYOKAWA that aimed to protect the shogun and Sonno Joi (slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) with Kondo and others, and went to the capital to become a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group). On May 13, he assassinated Yoshio TONOUCHI at Shijo-Ohashi Bridge with Kondo and Kamo SERIZAWA due to the hegemony dispute within the troops. In doing so, Mibu-Roshigumi, which gained the hegemony through an illicit union of Kondo\u2019s and Serizawa\u2019s group, placed Kondo and Serizawa as leaders and Sannan was appointed to be an assistant head (vice chief) with Toshizo HIJIKATA as a member of the Kondo group (Nishiki NIIMI from Serizawa group). The roshi-gumi was formed with aims for Sonno Joi, but it was under the custody of the Aizu clan, so he devoted himself to cracking down on repined masterless samurai in Kyoto. Around August 1863, Sannan and Hijikata had a fierce battle against a few repined masterless samurai who intruded into a kimono fabrics dealer called 'Iwaki Shoya\u2019 and repelled them. Sannan also joined a coup on September 30 and killed roshi (masterless samurai) from the Choshu group, who were hiding in Kyoto, with Hijikata two days later. In October 1863, he joined the assassination of Kamo SERIZAWA who had been feuding for a while. The roshi-gumi was unified by the Kondo group (Sieikanha group), and Sannan was appointed to the chief for the organizational restructuring and positioned himself between the leader Kondo and the vice chief Toshizo HIJIKATA. However, he escaped after this incident. His name disappeared from the activity report of Shinsengumi until he committed Seppuku (suicide by disembowelment). He did not join the Ikedaya Incident in July 1864. (Some say that he had been sick or protected the quarter during this time.) In December 1864, Kashitaro ITO was enrolled in the troops. Ito was Sannan\u2019s fellow from the Hokushin-Ittoryu Kobudo School, an extreme proponent of Sonno Joi, and educated person. Ito was appointed to a higher rank position of general staff than Sannan and received special treatment. Escape In March 1865, Sannan left a note saying 'I\u2019m going to Edo\u2019 and escaped from Shinsengumi. Escape was a capital crime according to the rules set forth by the Shinsengumi. Kondo and Hijikata sent Okita to chase him, and Sannan was was captured in Omi Province, Otsu City and brought back to the quarter. (*Some say it was not an escape.) There were several theories on the reasons behind Sannan\u2019s escape. According to Kanefumi NISHIMURA, a valet of West Hongan-ji Temple, the issue of relocating the quarter is what drove Sannan into the corner. It was to move the quarter from Mibu to West Hongan-ji Temple. The reason was not only because Mibu was too cramped as the members grew in number, but also because West Hongan-ji Temple had strong loyalty to the Emperor and had close relationship with the Mori family of Choshu Domain. Moving to the temple, Hijikata thought to eradicate it all at once. Therefore, although the temple wanted to stop the transfer, he stubbornly refused to listen. Sannan, who was high-spirited in his loyalty to the Emperor, strongly opposed it, but Kondo and Hijikata paid absolutely no attention to him. Sannan, angry that he was being ignored, finally decided to break away from Shinsengumi. Some say that he had doubts on the way Shinsengumi was organized as what they actually did was oppress supporters when in fact it was meant to be organized for Sonno Joi. Some say that he made a secret promise with Ito, who would later withdrew from Shinsengumi. According to 'Roshi (masterless samurai) Bunkyu Era Patriotism Articles\u2019 (written by Shinpachi NAGAKURA) found in 1998, he stayed in the quarter on the day of security patrol on July 29, 1864 due to the illness. Also, there is no statement about Sannan on the Kinmon Incident in the article, so some say that he suffered from illness. Seppuku He was advised to escape again by a top official, Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Ito, who had a long lasting relationship since they met in Shieikan, but Sannan prepared himself for death. This sad story was told that through Nagakura\u2019s kind offices, Sannan\u2019s old friend, Tenjin (upper rank prostitute) Akesato in Shimabara, who came to see Sannan and bade him a last farewell (but there was no description of Akesato in Nagakura\u2019s journal 'Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki\u2019 and 'Roshi Bunkyu Era Patriotism Articles,\u2019 so it was highly likely that this was created by Kan SHIMOZAWA). On March 20, 1865, he died from Seppuku. Sannan wanted Soji OKITA, whom he treated like his brother, to be Kaishaku (to assist someone in committing Seppuku by beheading him). He was 33 years old. Kondo praised his Seppuku as 'even Takuminokami ASANO couldn\u2019t die this beautifully.\u2019 Keisuke SANNAN was adored in Shinsengumi, and even Toshizo HIJIKATA, who was famous for the devil vice chief, cried when Keisuke SANNAN committed Seppuku. His grave is in Koen-ji Temple in Kyoto. Kashitaro ITO wrote four poems of waka in mourning Sannan\u2019s death. Characters and others. Sannan was a kind-hearted person and was adored by women and children in Mibu area. There was a saying 'kind persons are Sannan and Chuji MATSUBARA\u2019 which was popular in the Mibu until the early Meiji period. According to \u201cShinsengumi Ibun (exceptional matters),\u201d he had a good reputation among troops and in the Mibu area, unlike Kamo SERIZAWA. Shikanosuke KOJIMA, a sponsor of Shinsengumi, described Sannan as a 'warrior but literate.\u2019 Even Kanefumi NISHIMURA, who was known for his sever criticism of Shinsengumi, called him 'a person who understands method of matters in some degree\u2019 in \u201cMibu Roshi Shimatsuki\u201d He was small in stature and had a fair-skinned lovable face. According to Tamesaburo YAGI who was a child of a house where the Shinsengumi was stationed, 'he was not so tall, had fair-skinned lovable face, liked kids and talked to them wherever he met them\u2019 (Rojin Mibu Banashi (the Aged Mibu Story) by Tamesaburo YAGI). It seemed that when he left for the coup on September 30, while Kondo and Hijikata wrapped themselves up in Kacchu (armor and helmet), Sannan as the head did not receive Kacchu, so he was mad but Chuji MATSUBARA served as a buffer to ease his anger. Iwaki Masuya Incident In February 1864, while he was staying in Osaka to guard Iemochi TOKUGAWA, a few repined masterless samurai intruded into a kimono fabrics dealer called 'Iwaki Shoya,\u2019 and both Toshizo HIJIKATA and Sannan rushed to the scene and repelled them after a fierce battle. For this achievement, Sannan received gold eight ryo (currency unit) from Katamori MATSUDAIRA. The sword (about 86.4cm) Sannan used in the incident was 'a work by Okimitsu SEKISHIN, the resident in Harima Province,\u2019 had a nicked edge, and was broken at about 33.3cm. The impression (paper that traced a shape of sword like fish prints) of this sword was sent to Shikanosuke KOJIMA by Hijikata\u2019s own hands, and even today, you can still see it in Kojima Shiryokan (Museum) (but the exhibit is a copy). According to \u201cIshin Shiseki Zusetsu (Restoration Historical Sites Book),\u201d Sannan injured his left arm in this incident, and one theory was that his arm became crippled due to this injury, so he reconciled himself to be rusui (a person representing the master during his absence) during the Ikedaya Incident, and losing his footing as samurai and having a different opinion from Kondo\u2019s and Hijikata\u2019s served to facilitate his escape from the Shinsengumi. On the other hand, there was another theory that he only stayed as the head of a left-behind team to prepare for the attack on the quarter of roshi in Nagato Province during the Ikedaya Incident. In addition, on the Iwaki Masuya Incident, one theory said that the incident occurred around August 1863 and another theory said that only Sannan rushed to the scene. In 2004, in the NHK Historical drama 'Shinsengumi!!\u2019 written by Koki Mitani, when Masato SAKAI, who was not very well known at that time, was hired to play the Keisuke SANNAN role, both Sakai and Sannan exploded in popularity. When he played the Sannan role, Sakai said that the smile he frequently showed was originally a smile to look down on the Tennenrishinryu group but gradually changed to become a caring smile, and this smile emphasized his benign image. NHK rebroadcasted (re-rebroadcasted to be exact) episode 33 'Friend\u2019s death\u2019 where Sannan committed Seppuku, entitled 'encore of 2004\u2019 after all episodes and omnibus were broadcast at the end of 2004. It was extremely rare for only one episode out of 49 episodes to be rebroadcast, and this 'Friend\u2019s death\u2019 had the most response from the audience in the 'Shinsengumi!\u2019 and it was said that some enthusiastic fans sent letters saying 'please do not kill Sannan-san.\u2019 (It seemed an impossible request on first glance, but on the other hand, Kenji NOGUCHI and a few others survived in 'Shinsengumi!\u2019 while they had been in fact killed historically. There was a precedent of Tokisuke HOJO in \u201cTokumune HOJO (NHK Historical drama)\u201d.) With the popularity of 'Shinsengumi!,\u2019 there was an explosive increase in the number of tourists visiting Koen-ji Temple where Sannan buried, former Maekawa residence, and Mibu-dera Temple. On March 11, 2007 when the tourists calmed down, 'Sannan-ki (memorial service for Sannan)\u2019 was held to mourn Keisuke SANNAN in the neighborhood of the former Maekawa residence, and a memorial event was held where offering of incense was made in the room where Keisuke SANNAN committed Seppuku. Incidentally, the festival to mourn an individual member of Shinsengumi was only fconducted for the five members of sami KONDO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, Hajime SAITO, and Keisuke SANNAN.

Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto, at the end of Edo period (there are two theories about the year of his birth, but no decisive historical materials against either of them have been found. Also, no historical materials confirming his birth date have ever been identified, and all that is known is that he was born in summer). He was the Assistant Vice Commander, captain of the First Corps and a master of kenjutsu sword fighting. His real family name was Fujiwara. His Imina (original name) was Harumasa and later, Kaneyoshi. His childhood name was Sojiro. He was the eldest son of Katsujiro OKITA, a clansman of Shirakawa Domain in Mutsu Province. He had two older sisters, one of whom, Mitsu OKITA, married Rintaro OKITA, making him the head of the family. Mitsu\u2019s great grand son Tetsuya OKITA (1930-) is a scholar of public administration and an emeritus professor of the department of politics and economics at Meiji University. Biography He was born in Shirakawa Domain\u2019s Edo residence (Minato Ward, Tokyo). His father Katsujiro died when he was four years old, and it is thought that his mother also died when he was young. At the age of about nine, he was apprenticed to Shuzo KONDO, who taught the Tennen Rishin-ryu style of martial arts at a dojo in Ichigaya, Edo, and it was here at the Shieikan dojo that he met fellow students Isami KONDO and Toshizo HIJIKATA, who would later be central in the formation of the Shinsengumi. Even though he was young, he served as the school manager of Tennenrishinryu. Okita\u2019s genius with the sword is said to have been unequalled although his teaching style was rather rough. Later in his life, he softened his teaching style. He joined the Roshigumi (an organization of masterless samurai) upon its formation in 1863 and left for Kyoto, remaining there with Kondo and forming the Shinsengumi after the group split. Okita\u2019s First Corps was constantly tasked with important missions and, although the Shinsengumi was filled with expert swordsmen, often had the most number of kills, and was involved in the assassinations of Kamo SERIZAWA and Hikojiro UCHIYAMA in October, 1863. Okita\u2019s first recorded kill was on the evening of May 11, 1863. His opponent was Yoshio TONOUCHI, a member of the Roshigumi\u2019s First Unit, who had come at Hachiro KIYOKAWA\u2019s request. After the Ikedaya Incident of July 8, 1864, where he was involved in the killings of several members of the anti-Shogunate faction, he collapsed after coughing up blood from tuberculosis (according to many theories) but based on his subsequent involvement in the Shinsengumi, it is unreasonable to think that he developed lung tuberculosis on that day. Instead, there is a theory that he collapsed from heat stroke. In February 1865, he was sent after Shinsengumi Vice Commander Keisuke YAMANAMI, who had attempted to desert, and arrested him in Kusatsu City, Omi Province. Yamanami committed suicide assisted by Okita. Although Okita seemed to regard Yamanami as an older brother, he barely touched upon Yamanami\u2019s death in a letter he sent home. He was active on the front lines until 1867, after which, unable to take part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he was escorted to Osaka. (The most widely-accepted theory at present is that he was injured on his way to the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and developed tuberculosis on the boat he was being escorted to Osaka on.) After defeat at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he sailed back to Edo with other members and although according to several theories he joined the Koyo Chinbutai (the successor to the Shinsengumi), he was forced to drop out halfway. After that, it is thought that Ryojun MATSUMOTO, a retainer of the Shogun, made arrangements for him to hide in a plant shop in Sendagaya, where he died in 1868. Since his date of birth is uncertain, there are several opinions about how old he was when he died, but he is believed to have been between twenty-five and twenty-seven. The purpose of their attack was to avenge the murder of their leader, Kashitaro ITO, by the Shinsengumi the previous month, but Okita had left for the Fushimi Magistrate\u2019s office and therefore escaped the attempt. In the evening of the same day, Isami KONDO was shot and injured by Abe and the others on his way back from Nijo Castle. In the evening on the same day, Isami KONDO was shot and got injured by Abe and other members when he was back from Nijo-jo Castle. Two months after Isami KONDO was beheaded, Okita died, unaware of KONDO\u2019s death. The poem he composed on his deathbed reads \u2018In the dark, flowers and water cannot be discerned unless they move\u2019 His grave is in Sensho-ji Temple in Motoazabu 3 cho-me, Minato Ward, Tokyo. His Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name) given by Sensho-ji Temple is Kenkoinjinyomeido-koji. The inscription on the Okita family grave stone states that he held menkyo-kaiden (a document handed down by a teacher to the student he believes is most capable of carrying on his art) for the Hokushin Itto-ryu school as well as Tennen Rishin-ryuu. There are three theories about his age when he died: twenty-four according to the Okita family grave stone; twenty-five according to documents held by the Okita family; and twenty-seven, if, as described in Shikanosuke KOJIMA\u2019s \u201cRyoyushiden\u201d, he was twenty-two when he left for Kyoto. There are also two opinions about the place where he died, one being Sendagaya and the other Imado (Taito Ward), but at present, it is widely accepted that after staying in Imado to recuperate for a while, he moved to Sendagaya and died there. Profile Shozan SAKUMA\u2019s son, Keinosuke MIURA, had been made fun of by a fellow Shinsengumi officer. There is a story that a few days later, Hijikata and Okita were playing a game of Go when Miura attacked the officer who had made fun of him from behind and Okita, infuriated by the cowardly attack, grabbed Miura by the collar and, calling him a 'bloody idiot\u2019, pushed his face into the floor until his nose was raw. Belying his appearance as an able leader of the Ichiban-gumi, he was apparently a cheerful person who was always telling jokes and laughing. It seems he often played with children in his neighborhood. When novelist Ryotaro SHIBA was writing a book featuring the Shinsengumi, he interviewed an old woman who used to play with Okita when she was small. (Taking into account that the interview took place around 1960 and that the Meiji Restoration was in 1868, the woman must have been quite old, but it means that people who actually met Soji OKITA were still alive.) Although Kanefumi NISHIMURA was known for severely criticizing Kondo, Hijikata and other members of the Shinsengumi, he left no comments on Okita or Keisuke YAMANAMI. This seems to show that Nishimura had no bad feelings towards Yamanami and Okita, and Okita is believed to have been easy-going towards people who were not hostile to the Shinsengumi. It is believed that just before his death, he tried several times to kill a black cat which often sneaked into the plant shop\u2019s yard but always missed and, realizing his own weakness, he said as follows. Alas, I cannot kill it!\u2019 See! (he said to the old woman who was attending him), I cannot kill it\u2019 (this story is said to have been created by Kan SHIMOZAWA.) There is also a story that he was worried about Kondo and, up until his death, he repeatedly asked, 'I am wondering how the master (Kondo) has been. Didn\u2019t we receive a letter from him?\u2019 Because people close to him were prohibited from telling him about Kondo\u2019s death, he passed away without learning of it. There is another anecdote that when Kondo was still alive and visiting Okita in bed before setting out with the Koyo Chinbutai, the usually cheerful Okita on this occasion sobbed loudly. It is generally thought that Kondo, Hijikata and Okita were very close to each other, with Hijikata and Okita in particular being like brothers, but this is largely the result of novels by Ryotaro SHIBA and Kan SHIMOZAWA. There are no materials to show that Hijikata and Okita were extremely close, although there is a record of Okita writing a letter on behalf of Hijikata. Juro ABE, who was opposed to the Shinsengumi, said, 'Kondo\u2019s high-caliber disciples, Soji OKITA and Kuwajiro OISHI, are very cruelhearted men and, from the beginning, appear not to have realized even the existence of the state or the Imperial Court\u2019 (\u201cShidankaisokkiroku\u201d) and attacked them and Izo OKADA for having no ideological background and for being used as \u201ctools to kill people\u201d. In addition, according to Okita\u2019s students, he was 'extremely harsh and quick-tempered\u2019 and they feared him more than the master, Kondo. The image of Okita gained from anecdotes such as his telling his trainees, 'Don\u2019t kill people with your sword! Kill them with your body!\u2019 and other records differs greatly from the gentle and calm image that is widely known in public. Sword Technique Okita\u2019s most famous sword technique is the 'Sandantsuki\u2019 (Three Stage Thrust). Starting from the Tennenrishin-ryu stance of 'hiraseigan\u2019, he delivered three thrusts in the time he was heard to take one step forward. It is often presented in novels as his opponent thinking he has been stabbed once when actually, in the blink of an eye, he has been stabbed three times. However, the exact details are unknown. According to Sen SATO in \u201cShinsengumi Ibun\u201d, Okita\u2019s sword style was identical to his master, Kondo\u2019s and even his thin, high-pitched yells were very alike. However, it is thought that he had a habit of leaning his body forward and holding his sword with the point slightly lowered, a slightly different posture to Kondo, who pushed his abdomen a little forward in the hiraseigan stance.) Shinpachi NAGAKURA\u2019s statement that Okita\u2019s technique 'left Toshizo HIJIKATA, Genzaburo INOUE, Heisuke TODO, Keisuke YAMANAMI and the others looking like children playing with bamboo swords. Everyone said that if Okita seriously fought his master, Kondo would lose,\u2019 (\u201cNagakura Shinpachi Idan,\u201d) is well-known but there are also comments to the same effect from outside the Shinsengumi\u2019s inner circle. Shikanosuke KOJIMA mentioned before the formation of Shinsengumi (in July 1862) that Okita 'is someone who will definitely reach the level of a master of the sword later in his life\u2019 (\u201cKojima Nikki\u201d) and Kanefumi NISHIMURA, although critical of the Shinsengumi, called him 'Kondo\u2019s most cherished follower and the best swordsman in his unit\u2019 and 'a genius with the sword\u2019 (\u201cMibu Roshi Shimatsuki\u201d). Juro ABE, who fought against the Shinsengumi, stated in \u201cShidankaisokkiroku\u201d that 'As one of Kondo\u2019s students, Soji OKITA is an excellent swordsman\u2019, \u2019 Soji OKITA and Kamajiro OISHI are young but have shown great skill with the sword on many occasions\u2019 and 'Kamajiro OISHI, Soji OKITA and Genzaburo INOUE have killed people without reason\u2019, all of which shows it would have been extremely dangerous to make enemies of them. The only negative opinion was from Yaichiro CHIBA, a member of the Shinchogumi (the Shinsengumi\u2019s Edo counterpart) and a colleague of Okita\u2019s brother-in-law, who said, 'from our viewpoint, their skills are suitable for mokuroku (a low level)\u2019 Of course, Nagakura\u2019s statement that Yamanami, who had attained 'menkyo-kaiden\u2019 in the Hokushin Itto-ryu, and Todo, who was almost at the mokuroku level, were like children seems extreme, but may imply how superb and outstanding Okita\u2019s skill with the sword was. Okita\u2019s Sword In novels, the sword owned by Soji OKITA is depicted as being a 'Kikuichimonji Norimune\u2019 (swords made at the beginning of the thirteenth century). The story gained popularity following its appearance in the novel \u201cShinsengumi Keppuroku\u201d by Ryotaro SHIBA, who based it on descriptions in biograraphies such as that by Kan SHIMOZAWA, where the sword is described as being 'a thin Kikuichimonji one\u2019. However, despite being a period when Japanese swords were everyday items, Norimune swords were extremely valuable old swords, and it is believed that, from an economical point of view and from the necessity of having to use it often in actual battles, Okita would hardly have been likely to own one, although the matter has hardly been discussed among researchers. Okita is known to have owned swords made by Kiyomitsu KASHU and Yasusada YAMATO NO KAMI. In addition to the Norimune swords, there were several other thin types of swords with a \u201cKikuniichi\u201d crest, and it is possible that Okita\u2019s sword may have been one of these. In any event, like the other members of the Shinsengumi, he is likely to have exchanged his swords often during his stay in Kyoto. A Handsome Youth Since his appearance in Ryotaro SHIBA\u2019s novels, he has often been depicted in fiction, including novels and TV series, as a handsome young man. Okita\u2019s likeness can be seen in a portrait that was painted in 1929 based on a claim by his older sister, Mitsu, that her grandson, Kaname, 'somehow resembles Soji\u2019. There are no descriptions of him being 'a handsome youth\u2019 from members of the Yagi family or from people connected to the Shinsengumi; instead, he is described as having a 'face like a flatfish, though tanned and not unnattractive when laughing\u2019, 'square shoulders\u2019, 'a rounded back\u2019 and being 'very tall.\u2019 (In \u201cRyoma ni omakase!\u201d (Leave things to Ryoma) and \u201cGetsumeiseiki - Sayonara Shinsengumi\u201d, the depiction of Okita was closer to the above.) The image that emerges from these descriptions casts doubt on the 'handsome youth\u2019 theory. Ryotaro SHIBA, wanting to enhance the drama (a young man killed by tuberculosis just as his skill with the sword is becoming legendary) in Okita\u2019s life and so made him a handsome young man in his novel \u201cMoeyo Ken\u201d, which was followed by many other works, including the movie \u201cBakumatsu Junjoden\u201d in which Okita was depicted as beatiful girl. The image of Okita as a handsome young man seems to come from the mistaken notion that the dramatized image of him as \u201ca powerful swordsman and cheerful but, at the same time, sickly and pale\u201d is the generally accepted image. The fact that Okita is always played on the screen by young, good-looking actors is also thought to have had a significant influence on his image. However, the origin of the 'Soji\u2019s face is like a flatfish\u2019 belief seemed to be a light jokey answer made by a great grand son of Hikogoro SATO when Haruo TANI said a lighthearted joke to him in a TV program, and according to Tani, 'Soji\u2019s face is like a flatfish\u2019 does not mean his face is flat but the two eyes of other family members including his sisters in photos are closely-spaced. However, Tetsuya OKITA completely rejected this idea. According to him, Soji was described within the Okita family as 'a light-skinned and small man\u2019. For likenesses and pictures, follow the external links. Soji OKITA\u2019s Romance Following his appearance in Ryotaro SHIBA\u2019s books, Okita is generally often depicted in fiction as a pure and innocent young man. Most works describe him as having a platonic relationship with the daughter of a local doctor, and in actual fact, he seems to have steered clear of women from Karyukai (the geisha district), unlike Kondo and Hijikata. However, according to the April 22, 1863 entry of his Matsugoro INOUE\u2019s diary, Hijikata, Matsugoro, Genzaburo INOUE and Okita paid for prostitutes at the Yoshidaya in the Kuken-cho area of the Shinmachi courtesan\u2019s district, so it cannot be said that he never played around with women, although when talk turned to a woman he was fond of, he became very serious. The register of deaths at Koen-ji Temple lists as 'Okita\u2019s relative\u2019 a woman who is thought to have been Okita\u2019s lover. According to the researchers, the woman\u2019s name was Tsune ISHII and she had a daughter. It is believed, but unproven, that the woman gave birth to Okita\u2019s daughter, who was named Kyo. There was another Okita in the Shinsengumi, a man called Jonoshin OKITA, who had been recruited by Hijikata in Edo in 1865, and there is a theory that the 'Okita\u2019 in the register of deaths may be Jonoshin. There is an old anecdote that a woman (who was apparently a strong-willed and spirited person) working in the Shieikan dojo asked Okita to marry her but he turned down her proposal, saying 'I am still an apprentice\u2019 (the woman attempted suicide, possibly because of his rejection, and later married another man after being introduced by Kondo). It is believed that this woman was Ko IWATA, who is thought to have been Shuhei KONDO\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. He is also thought to have been close to a girl called Kin, the daughter of the Satomo Inn on Aburakoji Street. Onset of Tuberculosis Works of fiction always have Soji OKITA coughing up blood and collapsing during the fighting in the Ikedaya Incident. However, as mentioned above, this anecdote is not supported by researchers. Reasons include the fact that the description of Okita\u2019s coughing up blood only appears in Kan SHIMOZAWA\u2019s \u201cShinsen-gumi Shimatsuki\u201d; Okita participated in the hunt for the remnants of the Choshu forces (see \u201cAkebonotei Jiken\u201d, the Akebonotei Incident); and there is a record (\u201cKoshi sensoki\u201d Kanefumi NISHIMURA) of him joining Isami KONDO, Saizo HIJIKATA, Kanryusai TAKEDA and Shinpachi NAGAKURA in the Kinmon Incident the following month, and if his tuberculosis was advanced enough to cause him to cough up blood, they would not have dared to let him go. There is another anecdote that after the Shinsengumi\u2019s group medical examination in around 1866, the shogunate\u2019s doctor, Ryojun MATSUMOTO, left a note that 'one of the members had pulmonary tuberculosis\u2019, and it is thought that the man may have been Soji OKITA. In 1867, the disease seems to have progressed enough that people around him noticed it; Shikanosuke KOJIMA in \u201cRyoyu jitsuroku\u201d said he contracted it in March; according to Kanefumi NISHIMURA\u2019s \u201cMibu Roshi Shimatsuki\u201d, he was seriously ill around September when the quarters were moved to Fudodo Village; and in a letter to Kondo dated October 13, Kojima wrote that he was worried about Okita\u2019s worsening condition. Given the above, when Okita\u2019s health condition worsened so critical that he could not bear fighting was from autumn to winter in 1867. It is also thought that his intense exercise might have been an added burden on his lungs and aggravated his illness. The scenes of Okita spitting blood and falling unconscious at the Ikedaya in works such as \u201cShinsengumi Shimatsuki\u201d seem to have originated in Shinpachi NAGAKURA\u2019s \u201cShinsengumi Tenmatsuki\u201d, which, while not mentioning spitting blood, does describe Okita falling unconscious. He may have suffered a light and temporary heat stroke following the intense battle, which took place on a humid and extremely hot day in early summer, and it is thought that his condition did not raise any questions about his lungs for those close to him, including Kondo and Nagakura.

11th (Lunar Calendar)(June 20, 1869)) was the vice commander of Shinsen-gumi, vice-minister of the Army for Ezo Republic, and also chief of the Court for Torishimari of Hakodate city. His imina (posthumous name) is Yoshitoyo. His pseudonym is Hogyoku. He was a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate at the end of Edo Period. Was feared by all as the vice commander of Shinsen-gumi. Family crest is Hidari Mitsudomoe Tama/Shiei-kan He was born in Ishida village, Tama district, Musashi province (is now Ishida, Hino city, Tokyo). (He has been said to be the youngest among 6 brothers and sisters, but materials discovered in recent years revealed that he was actually the youngest among 10 brothers and sisters.) The HIJIKATA family was a wealthy farmer called \u201cOdaijin\u201d who had farmed on large stretches of land in the Tama region for generations. He lost his father before he was born and his mother at the age of 6, and he was brought up by his second oldest brother, Kiroku and Kiroku\u2019s wife. Until now, it has been said that he went to work at \u201cMatsuzakaya Ito Gofuku store\u201d (present-day Matsuzakaya Ueno store) in Ueno, Edo at the age of 11, but soon quarreled with the head clerk and returned to Hino; according to a newly published copy of Ninbetsu-cho of Ishida village it became clear that he was living in Ishida village when he was 11 years old, and therefore had not yet gone to work at the store. Although there are some missing parts based on this Ninbetsu-cho it is assumed that Toshizo went to work for a period of 10 years from the age of 14 to 24 (counted in the old Japanese way). There is a legend that he was sent to work at a cotton wholesale store (called Kamedana, in comparison with the Ueno store which was called Tsurudana) in Edo Tenma-cho, a branch of Matsuzakaya Ueno store, but because he had problems with a woman there (there is also a rumor that he was forced into a sexual relationship by the head clerk) he returned to Hino; however, due to the existence of the Ninbetsu-cho described above, the reliability of such stories are now in doubt. Subsequently, it is said that he traveled and sold \u201cIshida Sanyaku medicine\u201d whose secret recipe has been passed on in his family; at the same time he also trained himself by fighting in many swordsmanship matches with other schools in dojos located around the country. It is around this time that he is assumed to have met Isami KONDO (who later became the commander of Shinsen-gumi), the 4th Head of Tennen Rishin-ryu, who was on a training trip to Sato Dojo in Hino; on March 29 1859, Toshizo formally became a disciple of Tennen Rishin-ryu. Toshizo\u2019s older sister, Nobu SATO, was married to Hikogoro SATO, who was also their cousin and Nanushi (headman of the city) of Hino-jyuku, Hino city; it is said that Toshizo often visited the residence of Hikogoro. Hikogoro once was nearly killed during a major fire; after this incident, and on the advice of Matsugoro INOUE, an older brother of Genzaburo INOUE, Hikogoro became a disciple of Tennen Rishin-ryu and started a Dojo in a corner of his house. Because of this background Hikogoro took a pledge of brotherhood with KONDO and supported Tennen Rishin-ryu. It is said that Toshizo also trained himself in swordsmanship at this Dojo. In February of the 3rd year of Bunkyu, Toshizo, together with his comrades of Kondo Dojo (Shiei-kan), applied for the Roshigumi to guard Iemochi TOKUGAWA, Seii Taishogun of the Shogunate, and departed for Kyoto. Vice Commander of Shinsenh-gumi After the political change on August 18 1863, the active role of Miburoshi-gumi was acknowledged, and Shinsen-gumi was set up. Subsequently, Nishiki NIMI committed hara-kiri, and Toshizo directly assassinated Kamo SERIZAWA and some others. Isami KONDO, who acquired power, became the commander. Toshizo assumed the position as vice commander, and as Isami KONDO\u2019s right hand man he engaged himself in maintaining peace and order in Kyoto. Systematic structure by each duty such as Jyokin, Kansatsu, etc., of Shinsen-gumi was formed, and while the Head of the organization was the commander, the actual directing orders were given by Toshizo, the vice commander. Upon Ikedaya Incident on June 5 1864, Toshizo lead half of the troop to search around Tantora (Shikokuya), visited frequently by members of the Choshyu clan and the Tosa clan, but nobody was there. He promptly rushed to Ikedaya to assist and immediately had his men draw their swords from the sheaths, but instead of entering the building they guarded the area around Ikedaya in order to prevent the soldiers of the Aizu and the Kuwana clans (who would arrive later) from entering Ikedaya, thereby ensuring that only Shinsen-gumi would receive full credit for the achievement. Such actions were taken with Shinsen-gumi\u2019s position, still weak at the time, in consideration. This was a tactful and calculating wit typical of Toshizo. Consequently, rewards received for Ikedaya Incident were unprecedented, and their names became widely known throughout the country. The Shogunate unofficially notified to assign KONDO as Yoriki Joseki (Head of Additional Soldiers) and Shinsen-gumi members as Yoriki (Additional Soldiers), but Toshizo persuaded KONDO not to settle for a Yoriki, aim for a Daimyo instead and wait for the next opportunity; KONDO heeded his advice. Within Shinsen-gumi, he always made members follow the rules of Shinsen-gumi and ordered a hara-kiri to the members who broke the rules; it is said that the members feared him. Therefore, it is said that the top reason for death of a Shinsen-gumi was due to hara-kiri. Also, members who escaped from Shinsen-gumi were made to conduct hara-kiri or were killed with a sword and [their bodies] exhibited as warning to others. Subsequently, the other vice commander, Keisuke YAMANAMI assumed the position of Soucho, and HIJIKATA became the only vice commander. Regarding the incident where YAMANAMI was ordered to conduct a hara-kiri after he lost his position within Shinsen-gumi and escaped [and captured], it is said that there was a dispute between YAMANAMI and HIJIKATA, but actually they seemed to have been good friends. After that, he also had Kisaburo KAWAI, Sanjyuro TANI, Kanryusai TAKEDA and others conduct hara-kiri, or had them killed by a sword so as to maintain the order within Shinsen-gumi. He sent Hajime SAITO to Goryoeji formed by Kashitaro ITO and took measures to successfully prevent ITO\u2019s plan to assassinate KONDO; he assassinated ITO and Heisuke TODO and completely destroyed Goryoeji (however, there are different stories regarding Goryoeji and ITO). Boshin War He was promoted to a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate in June, 1867. However, on October 14th of the same year, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA resigned from the position of Seii Taishogun, and upon Restoration of the Imperial Rule (Japan) on December 9th, the Shogunate essentially collapsed. On January, 13th, 4th year of Keio, Boshin War started with the Battle of Toba Fushimi; in place of Isami KONDO, who was wounded in Sumizome Incident, Toshizo lead Shinsen-gumi and fought as a deputy of commander but was defeated against the army of the new government in gun fighting. From around the 1st year of Keio, prior to being defeated in Battle of Toba Fushimi, Toshizo realized that from now on war could not be fought with swords and he started to prepare western-style armaments. After the Shogunate army lost Battle of Toba Fushimi and retreated from Osaka to Edo, KONDO temporarily named himself Yamato OKUBO and Toshizo named himself Hayato NAITO, and they set off to Kai province. However, on March 6th they were defeated in Battle of Kosyu Katsunuma. Toshizo rushed to request for reinforcements but was not successful. Subsequently, they were trying to recover power in Nagareyama but on April 3rd, they were suddenly surrounded by the army of the new government; the commander, KONDO, surrendered himself to the army of the new government. On this occasion, it is said that Toshizo stopped KONDO from committing hara-kiri, and persuaded KONDO to present himself to the army of the new government. Toshizo went to Edo and directly negotiated with Kaishu KATSU and others and pleaded them to spare KONDO\u2019s life, but he was not successful; KONDO was executed (beheaded) on April 25 1868, at a place close to Itabashi (currently, his tomb is located in front of JR Itabashi Station). After KONDO surrendered himself to the army of the new government, Toshizo, besides pleading for KONDO\u2019s life, entrusted Shinsen-gumi in the care of Hajime SAITO (Jiro YAMAGUCHI) and made them go to Aizu; Toshizo took only a few members including Kai SHIMADA and joined the army led by Keisuke OTORI and others, which was formed by men who escaped from the army of the former Shogunate. On April 11th, when evacuation of Edo Castle without bloodshed succeded, Toshizo escaped from Edo and acted as a staff officer of the vanguard army led by Noborinosuke AKIZUKI. They passed through the Shimodate clan and the Shimotsuma clan, and won the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle and conquered Utsunomiya Castle. However, they lost Battle of Mibu and fled; they fought again with the army of the new government in Utsunomiya during which Toshizo injured his leg; he was escorted to Aizu before the main army arrived in Aizu. In Aizu, he spent 3 months in recuperation, and it is said that during this time he built Isami KONDO\u2019s tomb in Tennei-ji Temple. After he fully recovered and returned to the battle line he endeavored to protect Aizu, but Battle of Aizu intensified after they lost the Battle of Bonari-toge in August. Toshizo visited the Shonai clan to request for reinforcements, but Shonai had already pledged allegiance to the new government and did not allow him to even enter the castle. Toshizo decided to depart for Sendai from Aizu. It is said that Jiro YAMAGUCHI (Hajime SAITO) and others appealed to Keisuke OTORI, who left the battle line in a way similar to Toshizo, that he should be as loyal as possible to the Aizu clan; however, this story comes from an old document which was recorded at a later date in Hakodate. HIJIKATA had not returned to Shinsen-gumi when they were in the domains of the Aizu clan. Shinsen-gumi broke up into the group of YAMAGUCHI and others who remained in the castle town and the group of members who left at Tennei-ji temple. Toshizo arrived in Sendai and joined the navy of the former Shogunate led by Takeaki ENOMOTO. Together with ENOMOTO Toshizo participated in military meetings of Ouetsu Reppan Domei (Northern Alliance) and was recommended to become General of Domei Army; however, Ouetsu Reppan Domei soon collapsed, and after the clans forming the Domei Army surrended one after another to the army of the new government, Toshizo decided to fight until the end, so long as there is a place where he can fight. The Shinsen-gumi members who remained alive boarded Oemaru along with the men from the Kuwana clan, and they left Orinohama, Sendai (currently, Orinohama, Ishinomaki city, Miyagi prefecture) with Takeaki ENOMOTO and others on October 12th and went to Ezo. Hakodate War (Died in the War) The image of Toshizo HIJIKATA After landing on Washinoki of Ezo on October 20th, Toshizo became General of Kando Army and headed for Goryokaku. Shinsen-gumi traveled by the main road under the leadership of General Keisuke OTORI, but a few members of Shinsen-gumi including Kai SHIMADA, are said to have followed Toshizo. After occupying Goryokaku in Hakodate Toshizo advanced his army including Gakuheitai army and others.; he conquered Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) and chased the retreating army of the enemy to Esashi. On this occasion, Takeaki ENOMOTO went to the offing of Esashi in order to support HIJIKATA\u2019s family from the sea, but his ship was stranded because of a storm. ENOMOTO, who landed in Esashi, and Toshizo watched Kaiyomaru sink, and they are said to have punched a pine tree which stood nearby and lamented together; the \u201cNageki no Matsu\u201d (pine tree of lament) still remains today. Toshizo, who managed to occupy Esashi, temporarily returned to Matsumae Castle; he returned to Goryokaku on December 15th for the Celebration of Conquest of Ezo held by ENOMOTO, to which ENOMOTO invited the consuls of various countries. Subsequently, an election to determine leaders was held, and Ezo Republic (headquarters in Goryokaku) was established; Toshizo, as one of the leaders, became vice-minister of the Army and concurrently served as Torishimari of Hakodate city and chief of the Court of the Army and the Navy. It is said that Toshizo remained calm in Hakodate. When ENOMOTO and others were drinking to celebrate the establishment of the Hakodate government Toshizo alone remained silent and said \u201cthis is not the time for jubilation.\u201d He was engaged in consolidating Hakodate/Goryokaku from January to February, and when the news of an attack by the army of the new government reached his ears in March Toshizo participated in Naval Battle of Miyakowan which targeted to seize Azuma-kan of the army of the new government; however, this operation failed, and many died or were wounded, but Toshizo managed to return safely. On April 9, 1869, the army of the new government started to land in Otobe, Ezo. Toshizo made every effort to defend against the attacks of the army of the new government in Battle of Futamataguchi. During the battle, the army of the new government rang bells to trick the enemy into thinking that they were surrounded; HIJIKATA\u2019s army thought that they were surrounded and was upset. Toshizo calmly judged the circumstances and calmed his men down by telling them that \u201cif our enemy really wished to surround us they would hide all noises so that we will not notice them.\u201d Also, in between the fighting, Toshizo himself went around and offered his men a drink of sake. He told them \u201conly one drink for each of you, as I do not want you to get drunk and break the rules of the army\u201d; his men laughed and agreed. Futamataguchi, which HIJIKATA army defended desparately, continued to win a series of battles. However, the other entrance at Matsumaeguchi fell under the attacks of the enemy, and as there was a risk of losing a route for a retreat they had no choice but to return to Goryokaku. The soldiers lead by OHNO, who were advancing in the direction of Daiba under the order of Toshizo, were temporarily regaining their power, but they suddenly lost control and suffered a total defeat despite OHNO\u2019s desperate instructions. OHNO had no choice but to return, and he was informed by Saisuke YASUTOMI, who was also an Assistant General of the Army, that Toshizo had died in the battle. Toshizo\u2019s body was claimed by Chonosuke KOSHIBA and others, and is said to have been buried either in Goryokaku with the bodies of others who died in the war or in another place. The other place [of burial] has not been specified. He died at the age of 35. His farewell poem was \u201cEven if my body decays around the islands of Ezo, my soul will protect my lord who lives in the East \u201d. The poem is also known as \u201cShould my body decay in the islands of Ezo, my soul will protect my lord who lives in the East.\u201d The locations of his tombs are: Sekidenji temple of Ishida, Hino city, Tokyo, Shomyo-ji temple of Funami-cho, Hakodate-city, Hokkaido (memorial). Tennei-ji temple of Higashiyamamachi, Aizu-Wakamatsu city, Fukushima prefecture (wooden memorial). Jyutokuji temple of Takinogawa, Kita-ku, Tokyo Entsuji temple of Minami Senju, Arakawa-ku, Tokyo, and others. Toshizo\u2019s Kosyo (servant; personal assisitant), Tetsunosuke ICHIMURA Just before his death, Toshizo handed locks of his hair to be kept as a memonto and his photograph to Tetsunosuke CHIMURA, who served him as Kosyo, and ordered Tetsunosuke to \u201cdeliver them to my family in Hino.\u201d ICHIMURA refused this request, saying \u201cI came here to die in battle, please give your order to someone else\u201d. On hearing this, Toshizo said with a glare \u201cif you refuse, I will kill you here now\u201d. ICHIMURA was overwhelmed by such strong spirit of Toshizo and agreed to carry out his order. When he departed for Hino, ICHIMURA realized that someone was standing by a window. ICHIMURA left the words that \u201cI could not tell who it was, but probably it was Mr. HIJIKATA\u201d. Subsequently, ICHIMURA managed to safely deliver Toshizo\u2019s articles to Hikogoro SATO at Hino-jyuku. His favorite swords were the sword, Izumi no Kami Kenesada and the small sword, Horikawa Kunihiro. Anecdotes It is said that when he was a child, he often remained naked after taking a bath, and practiced Sumo with a pillar in his house. The pillar still exists today. =&gt; A story that has been handed down in the HIJIKATA family. Taken from \u201cTaizo HIJIKATA told by his descendants\u201d written by Meguji HIJIKATA. The pillar is kept at Hijikata Toshizo Museum. When his nephew (Hikogoro SATO\u2019s 3rd son, Tamekichi) fell down in the garden and cut his forehead, it is said that Taizo immediately rushed towards Tamekichi, laughed and caressed the boy saying, \u201cthe boy is wounded when he was confronting the world, so joyful, so joyful.\u201d =&gt; A story that has been handed down in the SATO family. Taken from \u201cKikigaki Shinsengumi\u201d written by Akira SATO. Only records of Chugokui Mokuroku awarded to Toshizo remain in Tennen-Rishin-ryu dojo today. It seems that he could not get rid of the ways of various schools which he learnt while he was traveling as a peddler. Nevertheless, it is said that he was awfully strong in actual fighting (it is said that he fought with no restraints, for example, by throwing the sand on the ground at his opponent and slashing or strangling him while heflinched from Toshizo\u2019s initial attack). As can be seen from his photo of a later year dressed in western clothing, it is said that Toshizo was a rationalist and had the flexibility to accept useful things; for example, he owned a western pocket watch, etc. He once said to colleagues of Shinsen-gumi who were close to him, \u201cprobably I am reborn from Nobunaga ODA\u201d. It is said that he created strict rules for Shinsen-gumi, such as Jinchu Hatto and Kyokuchu Hatto, and mercilessly killed betrayers or those who did not follow the rules; he was referred to as the pitiless vice commander, and in general, he was considered to be a heartless person. However, according to Nobori NAKAJIMA who followed Toshizo up to Hakodate War, at the time of Hakodate War \u201che was mild and was admired by his men as if he was their mother.\u201d It is said that around this time, he started to often take young members of Shinsen-gumi out to meals and drink, and he listened to and advise them on their problems. However, there is a view that this was not because he has become older, but this was a calculated action based on his realization that he has found a place to die, as well as for motivating his men who could die tomorrow in a battle. Because he was a tall (for that time), handsome man with a fair complexion and firm features he was very popular among ladies; when he was acting as the vice commander of Shinsen-gumi in Kyoto he sent to his colleagues in Hino a bundle of love letters he had received from many women so as to boast his popularity. Soon after he went to Kyoto, a large package from him arrived in attention to Shikanosuke KOJIMA (one story says that the package was addressed to the disciples of KONDO Dojo). Shikanosuke opened the package thinking that Toshizo might have sent presents from Kyoto, but the package was filled with love letters from geishas and apprentice geishas who were in love with Toshizo. The following tanka poem is said to have accompanied the letter [from Toshizo]: Ladies make me forget to do my best for my country. =&gt; a story told by Shikanosuke KOJIMA. Taken from \u201cShinsen-gumi Yowa\u201d written by Masataka KOJIMA. Toshizo, who had his leg wounded in Battle of Utsunomiya, was in sickbed at an inn in the castle town of Aizu Wakamatsu from around April to July of 1868 (there are different views regarding the period). One day, Mitsuzo MOCHIZUKI, a vassal of the Shogunate and a public servant who was staying at the same inn as Toshizo, visited him, but Toshizo remained in his bed and said to him, \u201cfight with us.\u201d MOCHIZUKI who got annoyed by this arrogant attitude refused by saying, \u201cI am a public servant so I cannot fight.\u201d Then Toshizo spoke unreservedly \u201cthen what did you come so far away for, you coward!\u201d MOCHIZUKI retorted that \u201cyou were fortunate enough to seize Utsunomiya Castle, but wasn\u2019t the castle soon retaken? It is probably difficult to seize the castle again now. How regrettable. I have no choice but to call you a coward, also\u201d. Toshizo, upon hearing Mochizuki, shouted \u201cShut up, you are making my illness worse. I do not want to hear any more from you, leave\u201d so MOCHIZUKI left his room. On this occasion, Toshizo was so angry that he threw his pillow at MOCHIZUKI. =&gt;Taken from \u201cYumeno Uwagoto\u201d written by Mitsuzo MOCHIZUKI and \u201cKokuhaku no Kokuhatsu\u201d written by Shison MOCHIZUKI. When Toshizo was in Edo, he normally stayed in Kamaya, an inn patronized by the Shogunate. It was one of the busy Chaya restaurants among Shinagawa-syuku, and the following record remains today: \u201cOn October 21st, the third year of Keio, family and disciples of the Shinsen-gumi member, Toshizo HIJIKATA, totaling 31 people rested, Hanuemon KAMAYA, fee was 9 kan and 300 mon.\u201d A memorial of Shinsen-gumi now stands at the site of Kamaya (currently, Aomono-yokocho Station, Shinagawa-ku). Hobbies Surprisingly, he was a person of taste, and he enjoyed making tanka poems and haiku, etc. He has written many poems and left poetry books such as \u201cHogyoku Hokku-shu,\u201d etc. I can see the spring moon on my way to a public duty. The crescent moon is shining at the bottom of a puddle formed by the spring rain. My heart is pure, as I face my reflection on the water. I listen to the sounds made by a plover, together with the sounds of water. I see the spring moon over the temple gate. If an apricot flower blooms, even if only one, it is still an apricot flower. The seven plants of spring, I manage to memorize up to five. I cannot help resting my hand as I dust the shelves, when I hear a warbler sing. It is cold sleeping in a shabby house, the spring moon shines above. The road of love, If you know it you are lost, if you know it not, you will not get lost. North of the waters, and south of the mountains, is the spring moon. The days and months of the year which pass by, I cannot do anything about it. The clouds of May fly towards my hometown. The road of love, If you know it you are lost, if you know it not, you will not get lost. It is indeed the month of March, some snow vanish as they fall. On the morning snow, there are no horizontal footsteps. Actors and voice artists who played Toshizo HIJIKATA Because of the excellent performance given in \u201cShinsengumi Keppuroku\u201d and \u201cMoeyo Ken\u201d, Asahi KURIZUKA is known as a legendary figure and a great actor playing the part of Toshizo HIJIKATA. It is well known that when Ryotaro SHIBA saw Asahi KURIZUKA wearing the uniform of Shinsen-gumi, SHIBA highly praised KURIZUKA.

Vice-commander of the Shinsengumi Born - 1833 or 1835 in Michinoka, Sendai. Died - February 23, 1865 in Mibu, Kyoto at either age 33 or 31 [32 or 30]. Names - Imina - Tomonobu One of the reasons why there is so little information about Yamanami is that some think this may have been an assumed name. Also, there is a question of how he pronounced his name. According to the way the kanji was read during the Edo period, he may have actually called himself \u201cSannan\u201d. Physical Description - Yamanami was \u201cslightly tall\u201d and had a pale complexion. His face was supposed to be somewhat round. Personality Quirks and Traits - He is described as a gentle, amiable man and was very intelligent. He enjoyed reading Chinese poetry. Yamanami was loved by the people of the Mibu neighborhood. Yet despite all of this he could be very severe when he needed to be. Aside from Kondo, it is said that he got along well with Okita, Todo, and Ito. His exact relationship with Hijikata is the subject of debate. Family History - Almost nothing is known of Yamanami\u2019s past. He may have been the second son of a fencing instructor. Another theory is that his father was a lower samurai of the Sendai clan. There was also an opinion that he was the third son of the family. Martial Skills - Ryu - Houkushin Itto Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Chiba Shusaku, Genbukan dojo Yamanami is thought to have went to Edo to study in his early teens. He attended one of the three most prestigious fencing schools of era, studying under one of the greatest swordmasters of all time. According to legend that was not enough to help him defeat Kondo Isami in a match. After losing to Tennen Rishin Ryu, Yamanami decided to retrain under Kondo and entered the Shieikan. This was probably around 1860. Later he was said to have taught classes on Kondo\u2019s behalf. Shinsengumi Years - Although he began in the Shinsengumi at the same rank as Hijikata, Yamanami gradually began to fade into the background. Even before Ikeda-ya he was playing no real role in leading the group anymore. The most enduring legend about him is how he met his death. The most widely known version of the story has it that Yamanami was unhappy with the way Kondo and Hijikata ran the Shinsengumi. He is also said to have felt that they were abandoning their true and original purpose of \u201cSonno-Joi\u201d or \u201cRevere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians\u201d. Things began to come to a head after Ikeda-ya, when the other two men began to make plans to move the headquarters from Mibu to the Nishihongan-ji Temple. Although Yamanami complained about it bitterly, saying that it was not an appropriate place for executions and the like, he was ignored. At that point he decided on drastic actions. Writing a brief note, he left the group without permission on February 22, 1865 [March 19, 1865] and headed to Otsu. As soon they realized that he was gone, Okita took a horse and went after him. An often speculated reason for sending him is that they did not really want for Yamanami to be captured. But at an inn in Otsu, find him Okita did. He was not even trying to really escape. Although the captain is often said to have urged him to flee, Yamanami insisted on being taken back to Mibu to face his punishment. Some have it that Nagakura and Ito tried to give him a second chance to escape once they returned to headquarters. Again Yamanami declined, saying that he had already made up his mind. At the Maekawa estate the very next day, February 23, 1865 [March 20, 1865], Hijikata ordered Yamanami to commit seppuku. Okita served as his second. The reasons for his actions are unknown. Some say that he simply wished to die. Others that he wanted his death to serve as a warning to Kondo. However this is only the generally known version of what happened to Yamanami. The truth may have been very different. First off it is questioned exactly what the nature of Hijikata and Yamanami\u2019s relationship was. Traditionally it has been said that they despised one another. Hijikata would complain that Yamanami was a \u201cfox\u201d and a \u201cpain in the rear\u201d for Kondo. And for his part Yamanami may have been jealous of the close relationship that the other Vice-commander had with the Commander. Yet there is also those who say that the two really respected one another. And there is evidence that this was true, at least before they came to Kyoto. Hijikata is supposed to have dedicated one of his poems to Yamanami while they were at the Shieikan together. As for the day that Yamanami \u201cescaped\u201d, the samurai of other domains reported seeing many of the Shinsengumi leaving their headquarters. This could mean that Okita was actually not the only one sent to bring him back or it may be that something entirely different may have happened to Yamanami which caused his death. It is claimed that Yamanami was suffering from some sort of neurosis at the time of his death. This may have been because his physical condition was not so good. There is a story that in 1864, around the time of the New Year\u2019s Holidays, Yamanami went to help Kondo stop a burglar at a shop in Kyoto. It is supposed that he either received a serious wound on his back during this incident or else that he fell seriously ill just afterwards. Which ever one of the two it may have been, something seems to have caused him to no longer be able to participate in the group\u2019s activities afterwards. He was given an \u201chonorary\u201d post at this time because he was forced from the front lines. Unable to do his job, he fell into a gloomy depression. Apparently his condition was serious enough that he was still unable to fight at Ikeda-ya. Illness is cited as the reason for his absence there. While this raises the possibility that it was a sickness that pushed him to the sidelines after the New Year\u2019s incident, it could have also been due to a deteriorating condition if he had indeed received a physical injury that permanently disabled him. For this reason he felt that he was useless to the group and was no longer able to influence it\u2019s policies. It was this constant brooding over his health and change in circumstances that may have finally led him to take his own life. The real truth of Yamanami\u2019s death will most likely always remain a mystery. There were many who regretted his death. He was buried at Kouenji Temple, where he had been on friendly terms with the chief priest. (This was because Yamanami\u2019s family crest and the one the temple used were the same.) Lots of people from Mibu as well as the Shinsengumi members attended his funeral. Love Life - Another enduring legend about Yamanami is the love affair he had with a Tenjin of Shimabara named Akesato. (A Tenjin was the second highest ranking class of prostitute at that time in Kyoto.) Although she was not extremely beautiful, she was considered to have been an elegant person. The day that he was to commit seppuku, the ceremony was delayed long enough for Nagakura to run to Shimabara and fetch Akesato. She came to the Maekawa estate and said a final, tearful farewell to him at the lattice window beside the main gate. This is all that is known of Akesato. The problem is that she may have never existed at all. There is no record of such a person working in Shimabara under that name at the time the Shinsengumi were in Kyoto. It is possible that such records may have been lost over time, but even worse is the fact that the sole source of this story is the work of Shimozawa Kan, who many suspect may have fabricated much of the \u201chistory\u201d he recorded about the Shinsengumi. Shimozawa claimed to have seen a record left by Saito Hajime from which he got many of his details about the group, but no one since has been able to find any trace of this book and so his story is suspect. Perhaps just as incriminating is the fact that Nagakura, the person who was supposed to have gone to get Akesato that day, does not mention such an episode at all. However the issue of whether or not she truly existed will most likely be debated for a long time to come.

[The Shirakawa clan mansion was located in the Roppongi area of Tokyo.] Died - May 30, 1868 in Sentagaya, Edo at either age 27 or 25. [July 19, 1868 in Sentagaya, Tokyo at either age 26 or 24.] Names - Imina - Kaneyoshi (Fusanaga) Childhood Name - Okita Sojiro It is generally considered that he shortened his name from \u201cSojiro\u201d to \u201cSoji\u201d around the time he joined the others in the Roshitai. It has also been suggested that Kondo may have called him this for short. There are some who refer to him as \u201cSoushi\u201d, but this name is not correct. Physical Description - Okita had a dark complexion, broad shoulders which may have had a bit of a stoop, and he was lean even before his illness. He was also in reality not very handsome, having what is described as a \u201cflatfish face\u201d. In height he was much taller than is generally depicted, perhaps either 166cm or 170cm (5'6\" or 5'7\"). Considering that he was supposed to be taller than Hijikata, probably the 170cm estimate is more correct. His voice is described as having been high-pitched and thin. This is far from the image of the \u201ccute young boy\u201d created by Shiba Ryotaro in \u201cMoeyo Ken\u201d. However it does not seem to have bothered the young ladies of Okita\u2019s time one bit. Personality Quirks and Traits - It is said that Okita tended to eat very lightly and would even leave banquets early. There\u2019s a possibility he had an unbalanced diet because of this. He was also known to have liked to drink, though perhaps not quite as much as some of his fellow Shinsengumi. It was rare for Okita to become serious. When he did it was usually because he was involved in a fight. At such times he could be ruthless. He was also known to have been short-tempered when training. Once inside a dojo his students feared him more than Kondo because of his strict and rough manner. He was very particular about swordsmanship and that made it hard for his students to please him. It is speculated that since he was so skilled, he may have had trouble understanding human clumsiness and weakness without ability. For the most part however he was someone who was always smiling. In Kyoto he would always joke around and try to make everyone else laugh. Generally he was successful. It has become legendary how Okita kept his sense of humor to the very end. Even in the final stages of TB Okita never lost his ability to smile, something for which he is still admired. The way in which he lived - and died - perhaps shows that the most powerful forms of courage are not to be found on any battlefield after all. Family History - Okita\u2019s father was Okita Katsujiro, an ashigaru kogashira (foot soldier captain) for the Shirakawa clan at their lower mansion in Edo. He passed away when his son was only about four. About his mother, nothing is known. He had two older sisters. The eldest was Mitsu, who seems to have raised Okita. She married Inoue Rintaro, who changed his name to Okita Rintaro. He was somehow related to Inoue Genzaburo and that probably explains how Okita later ended up at the Shieikan. The second sister was Kin. She married a samurai from Edo. His name may have been Yoshihide Nagano and he may have been from the Mineyama province. Before the Shinsengumi - It is not known for certain in what year Okita was born. For a long time the year 1844 was accepted because this is what the family said. However a public document that recorded his entry into the Roshitai gives his birthyear as 1842. Because it was an officially recorded record, many now believe this was the correct year of his birth. Family legend has it that Okita was born during either a terrible thunderstorm or during a solar eclipse. And it appears that there was indeed a solar eclipse in June of 1842, the year now most commonly given as his birthyear. He was very close to Kondo from the time that he first joined the Shieikan, but his real relationship with Hijikata is not as certain. Probably the story that they were \u201clike brothers\u201d is exaggerated, but there is evidence that they were at least friendly with each other. At any rate Hijikata used to accompany him as his assistant when he would give lessons at the Sato house or in Onoji so that he could visit his relatives. This meant that the two had to be able to work together and spent a great deal of time in each other\u2019s company at any rate. Okita would often help the Sato family by cleaning the dojo for them, working in the garden, or running errands. He may have even been given \u201cpocket money\u201d by Hijikata\u2019s sister, Nobu. In the middle of July, 1862 and less than a year before joining the Roshitai, Okita became seriously sick with measles while teaching at the home of a student. This may have possibly weakened his immune system, making him more susceptible to the TB which would eventually claim his life. Martial Skills- Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Kondo Shusuke and Kondo Isami, Shieikan dojo Okita is supposed to have joined the Shieikan when he was around the age of 9 [8], due to his family\u2019s poor status. Considering which birthyear is used, this means he either joined in the spring of 1850 or that he joined in 1852. He had a natural ability when it came to swordsmanship and it was said he could use a katana (Japanese sword), bokken (wooden training sword), or a shinai (bamboo training sword) equally well. There is a story that when he was around the age of 12, he defeated the fencing instructor of the Shirakawa clan. By the time the group went to Kyoto, Okita had reached full mastership of Tennen Rishin Ryu. Like Kondo, Okita traveled all around the Tama area to give lessons for the Shieikan. One can speculate that many of his students did not look forward to these at all because of his strict nature as a teacher. His famous personally developed technique was the \u201csandanzuki\u201d or \u201cthree-part thrust\u201d. This move involved a strike to the neck, then the left shoulder followed by the right shoulder. It is said that he could deliver these thrusts in very quick succession. Another technique he favored was the \u201cseigan\u201d stance. In Tennen Rishin Ryu it started out with him holding the grip in front of his belly and the tip pointed at the opponent\u2019s throat. He would then pull back his left shoulder slightly and move his left foot out so that he took a slanted stance. The apparent aim of this stance was to draw out an opponent by making him think he saw an opening, then delivering a quick thrust. His Sword(s) - Long Sword - Kiyomitsu Kaga - 74cm in length Long Sword - Kikuichi Norimune - 2'4\"2 The Kiyomitsu Kaga was described as being a very practical sword and was a blade that Okita very definitely owned. He was using this particular sword during the fight at Ikeda-ya, but the point broke off during the battle. He was probably never able to use it again afterwards. The Kikuichi Norimune that legend says he owned is far more questionable. This was an extremely sought after and expensive sword that even many daimyo could not have afforded. If Okita did have such a blade, then it would have been a gift from someone very wealthy. Some claim that the sword he actually owned was a Yamato no Kami Yasusada, made by a 17 th century swordsmith in Musashi. Though it was a good deal less expensive than a Norimune, it was still a fairly famous blade and highly doubtful that he could have really owned one. One of the reasons that no one can determine what sort of blade he really had was because it has been lost. There are several stories about what happened to Okita\u2019s sword. One version has it that after his death, his sister Mitsu was going somewhere with it while riding in a rickshaw. She accidently forgot the sword when she got out and was never able to recover it again. Shinsengumi Years - Okita started in the Mibu Roshi as a captain and held this position until the start of the Boshin War, when his illness forced him to stop fighting. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was the Captain of the First Unit and a teacher of kenjutsu. Aside from being a major joker, Okita is most remembered for playing with the local children at Mibudera. He was also one of the three strongest swordsman in the group, along with Nagakura and Saito. There is much debate on whether he or Saito deserves the title of the \u201cThe Strongest\u201d. During the raid at Ikeda-ya, it is said that Okita fainted from lung trouble. It is not clear whether this was the first sign of his having tuberculosis or if this was a different ailment. Once it was discovered that he was sick with the disease, it was kept a secret for as long as possible. However by the time of the Battle of Toba-Fushimi is had progressed to the point to where he was no longer able to fight. He had to wait with Kondo for them to return to Osaka and just before they left by boat for Edo, he was so sick that he was bedridden. He went to see Matsumoto with Kondo as soon as they arrived in the city. There are at least two different locations where Okita was supposed to have been taken while trying to recover from his tuberculosis. One may have been the often referred to \u201ctuberculosis hospital\u201d. A more definite location is the house of one Uekiya Heigoro in Sentagaya, Edo, near the Ikejiri bridge. Looking out from the gate of the house, one could see the bridge. There were a lot of huge old trees at the time, one of them being a large cedar. On the far side of the stream, on the right-hand side was a watermill. This was considered to be a rather scary place after dark that was frequented by supernatural animals such as fox and tanuki (raccoon dogs). Okita was given a detached room looking out onto the garden. When Kondo and Hijikata marched to Kofu, Okita was feeling well enough to go with them as far as Tama. He visited the Sato family and entertained everyone by doing an impression of a sumo wrestler\u2019s stamp. However he took a turn for the worse soon after and had to be sent back to Edo. During his final days Okita asked repeatedly about Kondo, but no one would tell him that the Commander had been captured and executed. Matsumoto is said to have tended him during this time, but it is very likely that the doctor was actually in Aizu by this time. It is the story that says he was at the Uekiya house that mentions the episode with the black cat. Every day at the same time this creature would come into the garden and stare at Okita. On the day that he died, May 30, 1868 [July 19, 1868], Okita had made up his mind to kill the animal and dragged himself out onto the engawa (veranda) in the attempt. It was here that they found his body. One reason why he may have wanted to kill it was because black cats were supposed to be omens of impending death for those with tuberculosis. There are many other superstitions though that might also account for his actions. Okita\u2019s grave is in the Roppongi area of Tokyo at the Senshouji Temple. This is very close to where the Shirakawa clan mansion he was born in once stood. Love Life - Matsumoto Ryojun was of the opinion that Okita was a \u201cseidouji\u201d or \u201cthe clean child\u201d, meaning that he was a virgin. He was not alone in this thought and there are many who claim Okita never had any relations with women or that at least he did not associate with them very much. There are other accounts however, which would suggest otherwise. The first woman problem Okita ever had is said to have took place while he was still at the Shieikan. There was a young woman who was somehow connected to the dojo at the time and she did the cleaning and washing there. Her name and age are unknown, but she was said to have been a \u201cspunky\u201d woman. She took a liking to Okita and eventually told him she wanted to be his wife. His response was to decline, saying that he was still training himself. The poor girl was so shocked that she tried to kill herself by stabbing herself in the neck. However she missed hitting a vital point and did not die. She later married into another family with the help of the Kondo family. Then there is the mysterious grave at Kouenji Temple in Kyoto which has a grave carved with the words \u201cOkita\u2019s relation\u201d. The \u201ckaimyo\u201d belongs to a woman and she passed away ahead of him. (She may have been buried on April 26, 1867 [May 29, 1867].) As far as can be known, Okita had no relatives at all in Kyoto. For this reason it is thought that she may have been his lover, but that she could not marry him for some reason. One rumor has it that she was the daughter of a doctor. (A separate story mentioned that Okita was dating such a woman, but that Kondo made him break off the relationship. Whether it has any connection to this woman was not clear.) Another legend about the mystery woman is that she bore Okita a daughter. Unfortunately there is no record of a child or what might have become of her if she did exist. Perhaps she really was the daughter of a doctor and Okita was forced to break off their relationship by Kondo, which would explain why they could not marry. Perhaps by then she was already pregnant and died in childbirth, a common occurrence back in those days. One can speculate endlessly, but the woman at Kouenji Temple has carried her secrets with her to the grave and is unlikely to give them up now.

[May 31, 1835 in Ishida, Hino, Tokyo.] Died - May 11, 1869 in Hakodate, Ezo at age 35. [June 20, 1869 in Hakodate, Hokkaido at age 34.] Names - Imina - Yoshitoyo Penname - Hogyoku Alternate Name - Naito Hayato Kaimyo - Saishin-inden-seizan-yoshitoyo-daikoji Hijikata took the name \u201cNaito Hayato\u201d when he became a high-ranking retainer of the Tokugawa on March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868]. The first name, Hayato, seems to have been chosen because it was part of his father\u2019s name. However he reverted back to his original name after Kondo was captured and executed. His \u201ckaimyo\u201d was chosen by Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu. It contains the elements \u201cinden\u201d and \u201cdaikoji\u201d which were normally only used for daimyo and the like. As the son of a farmer, this was a huge honor that was granted toward him. The fact that he could use his surname openly before the end of his life was another oddity. At the beginning of the Edo period, the shogunate had abolished the right of anyone below the social rank of samurai to have a surname. For many this was not a problem since they did not have a family name anyway. However leading families such as Hijikata\u2019s did have one and were forced to make them into \u201csecret names\u201d known only to themselves and to very close friends in much the same manner as their \u201cimina\u201d or \u201chidden personal names\u201d. It was not until he went to Kyoto that Hijikata was able to use his surname openly. Physical Description - Hijikata was considered to have \u201clooked like an actor\u201d and to have been handsome almost to the point of being beyond belief. He turned the heads of women wherever he went and many fell in love with him on sight. His complexion was pale and his hair was so black that it was almost blue. In height he was around 165cm - 167cm tall (about 5'5\" - 5'6\"), which was tall compared to most men of his era when the average height was between 154cm - 158cm (5'0\" - 5'1\"). The 165cm is probably closer to his real height since Okita was said to have been taller than he was. He also had a slight \u201cstoop\u201d to his shoulders. In his dress he appears to have been very tasteful. One person who saw him while he was in Kyoto claimed that he looked like a daimyo. On that occasion he had been wearing a black crested kimono and a hakama of sendaihara silk. Personality Quirks and Traits - Hijikata is known for his hobby of writing haiku under the name \u201cHogyoku\u201d. Before leaving for Kyoto he compiled everything that he had written into a collection which he left with his family. Most who have read his work say that it is not very good. It is thought that he was fond of ume (variously translated as plum or apricot, but not really either) since many of his haiku had references to the flowers. There was also a blossom carved on the tsuba (handguard) of his sword and the saya (sheath) is also decorated with a few as well. His favorite color was said to be red and even the face mask he wore in training was tied with a red cord. One of Hijikata\u2019s favorite foods was takuwan (pickled radish), especially the ones made by his Hashimoto relatives. Once while visiting with them he praised it so much that the master of the house told him he could take home as many as he thought he would need. This made Hijikata very happy and he took the whole bucket with him! (Note that takuwan is said to have a very strong smell and that the bucket was probably fairly big since the incident was remembered.) Hijikata is often referred to as the \u201cOnifukuchou\u201d or \u201cDemon Vice-commander\u201d of the Shinsengumi because of his cruel nature. In reality this does not appear to have been the case. Rather the notion is mostly the creation of the novel \u201cMoeyo Ken\u201d by Shiba Ryotaro. As for the real man, it is recorded that in character he was a plain, frank person who spoke little and rarely laughed or smiled. In Hakodate it was observed that he never behaved in any manner that was not completely befitting a samurai even in private. This natural reserve caused many to think of him as being stricter than he really was. Hijikata is frequently described by those who met him as having been a kind and amiable man. One visitor to the Shinsengumi reported that even sitting face-to-face with the Vice-commander never seemed in any way unpleasant and that he was actually a \u201cfriendly-feeling person\u201d. By the time that he went to Hakodate this trait had become even more noticeable and Shinsengumi member Nakajima Nobori wrote of how \u201cgentle\u201d he became in his later years in the inscription of his famous portrait of Hijikata. This is not to say that he had a bland personality. As a leader he was charismatic, inspiring loyalty and trust in his followers. His troops in Hakodate adored him and one later recalled that upon hearing of his death they all \u201ccried like babes who had lost their mother\u201d. Even during the years in Kyoto those under him do not appear to have found his methods to be overly drastic or forceful. Matsumoto Ryojun, a doctor for the Tokugawa government who sometimes tended to the Shinsengumi, was of the opinion that the group would have fell apart much sooner if not for Hijikata. His presence was generally enough to keep Kondo from making serious mistakes that would have made it impossible for the Commander to have good relations with the rest of the group. And when the petition was filed against Kondo by Nagakura and others, not one word was said against Hijikata. Although many sources report that as a child he was a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d and a \u201cbully\u201d to strangers, but so far there is not a ready explanation of where the idea came from. Those who knew him seem to have regarded him as a good boy actually and when tales about the amount of bloodletting he was responsible for in Kyoto reached Tama they were not believed. And an often repeated comment about him in Hakodate is that he \u201creturned to his original nature\u201d there, implying that he was considered to have been a gentle person before leaving for Kyoto. Possibly his refusal to remain at the shop in Edo is the basis of this claim that he was a \u201cbrat\u201d. A little more on the negative side, Hijikata\u2019s infamy apparently amused him to some degree. He also seems to have had a bit of a dark and quirky sense of humor at times. On a visit home he shocked people by claiming that one of his swords had been ruined by all the blood from his many fights. On another occasion he sent a package to the students training at the Shieikan with a note saying, \u201cI send you something precious.\u201d When they opened it, they discovered that it contained a bundle of love letters that women in Kyoto had written to the Vice-commander. The youths found this very funny and declared that, \u201cToshi-san gains another point!\u201d Though for the most part Hijikata was very calm and never acted rashly in the face of danger. It was very rare for him to lose his temper over anything and he was considered to be a tolerant person. However a shogunate scholar of western studies named Kato Hiroyuki commented that once Hijikata did become angry about something, he was even stormier than Kondo. Of the two, the shogunate found the Vice-commander much more difficult to control. There are many testaments left about his courage on the battlefield and he was said to have been the bravest man in Ezo during the fighting there. He was even better known for his skills as a strategist and his efficiency in getting tasks done. A relative named Hashimoto Masano recalled that Hijikata had read many books, but that his knowledge of warfare seemed to have been an inborn thing with him. Another to be impressed with his martial skills was Frenchman Jules Brunet. He referred to Hijikata as \u201ca true warrior\u201d and speculated that had he been in a European army, he would have been made a general. Another trait worth mentioning was his practicality. He easily adopted new ideas if their worth could be proven to him. During the time the Shinsengumi was active in Kyoto, eating meat was not a common practice. But when Matsumoto told Hijikata of the nutritional value of adding pork and chicken to their diet, the Vice-commander ordered his men to begin raising the animals for food. Katsu Kaishu perhaps summed up this remarkable individual best when he called Hijikata \u201cone man of great caliber.\u201d Family History - Father - Yoshiatsu (Hayato) - 1792-1835, age 44 [43]. Mother - Etsu - 1792-1840, age 49 [48]. First Son - Tamejiro - 1812-1883, age 72 [71]. Second Son - no name - October 11, 1813 (premature death). Third Son - no name - June 12, 1815 (premature death). Fourth Son - Kiroku - 1819-1860, age 42 [41]. First Daughter - no name - August 4, 1821 (premature death). Second Daughter - no name - May 5, 1822 (premature death). Third Daughter - Shuu - 1823-1838, age 16 [15]. Fifth Son - Daisaku - 1828-1877, age 50 [49]. Fourth Daughter - Nobu - 1831-1877, age 47 [46]. Sixth Son - Toshizo - 1835-1869, age 35 [34]. Hijikata\u2019s father died several months before he was born. It appears that the cause of his death may have been tuberculosis. His sister Shuu is also rumored to have been isolated for the disease before she passed away in 1838, when Hijikata was 4 [3]. Two years later his mother passed away and TB is again speculated to have been the cause of her death. Hijikata was only 6 [5] at the time. Tamejiro, the eldest son, was blind and unable to inherit the family property. He was a refined person who enjoyed joruri and tanaka and was probably the inspiration for Hijikata\u2019s own attempts at haiku. He also never let his handicap get in his way. On one occasion when he was returning home from a brothel he found that the Tamagawa (Tama river) had flooded. Instead of stopping he merely wound his clothes on top of his head and waded across. Kiroku inherited his father\u2019s estate as the next oldest son. It was he and his wife who raised Hijikata after the death of their mother. (He lived with Kiroku up until about the age of 11.) Kiroku\u2019s attempt to set his little brother up in a career with a major store in Edo unfortunately failed because Hijikata would not co-operate and this perhaps strained their relationship a bit. He did not live to see Hijikata become a success in the Shinsengumi, passing away in 1860 - three years before the group was to form. Daisaku was adopted by another family which practiced medicine. He changed his name to Kasuya Ryojun and became a doctor. He apparently had excellent calligraphy skills and is thought to have written the sign outside of the Shinsengumi\u2019s headquarters in Mibu. Nobu married a cousin named Sato Hikogoro. Sato\u2019s mother, Masa, was their father\u2019s sister and it was her wish that Nobu and Hikogoro marry. After losing the job Kiroku had gotten for him, Hijikata lived more often at the Sato house. Hikogoro was described as a \u201cstout-hearted\u201d person and the two of them got along very well. Sato also had a dojo built in his home to study Tennen Rishin Ryu because he was concerned about bandits and thieves. It was Kondo Isami who would come to teach these classes, which is how Hijikata first got to know him. Though the Hijikata family were wealthy farmers of the Tama region. They lived in the Ishida village in Tama, Musashi province. Originally they had lived north of Ishida temple, but were later forced to move to another house near Mangan-ji Temple. The reason was the massive flooding of the Tamagawa in the June of 1846. Part of their property was severely damaged. Hijikata was 12 [11] at the time. In 1989 it was deemed impossible to save this second family home any longer and the place was torn down, though the Hijikata family still owns the property and rebuilt there. Takahatasan Kongo-ji Temple (Takahata Fudoson) was their family temple. It is of the Shingon Sect and one of the three great Fudo temples in the Kanto region. A statue of Hijikata in his Shinsengumi uniform now stands on the grounds next to the Benten pond. Hijikata\u2019s family also had relatives in the village of Onoji who were named Hashimoto. When he went to the village to teach later on, he would often stay with a Hashimoto Michisuke. This may have been the person who gave him the takuwan. There was also a Hashimoto Masanao. The family was indirectly related to Kojima Shikanosuke through a grandmother in the Hashimoto family. (Ages of the Hijikata family in 1835.) Father - deceased Mother - 44 [43] Tamejiro - 24 [23] Kiroku - 17 [16] Shuu - 13 [12] Daisaku - 8 [7] Nobu - 5 [4] Before the Shinsengumi - When he was around 11 years old, Hijikata planted an arrow bamboo plant on the family property with the wish that he could become a samurai and win a reputation. The arrow bamboo is still growing today and stands proudly near the entrance of a datahall attached to the family home where many important Shinsengumi mementos are kept. Also at the datahall is a pillar that was rescued from the old house. Hijikata would use it to practice the \u201charite\u201d or \u201cslapping\u201d of sumo wrestling. Around 1845, when Hijikata was 11 [10], Kiroku got him a job at a shop in Ueno, Edo called the Ito-Gofukuten. (This store is now called Matsuzakaya and is a very high-class place.) It sold kimono fabric and had a \u201cmen only\u201d household. As a younger brother, Hijikata himself could inherit nothing and so was very poor himself. Kiroku obviously wanted to ensure that he could someday be independent and most likely went through a lot of trouble to make this arrangement for him. Unfortunately these plans had been made without reckoning with Hijikata himself. Soon after being brought to the shop he quarreled with one of the clerks (some stories say it was actually the owner) and ran away. He returned to Tama along the Kousiyuu Highway, which was a distance of 36km (a bit over 22 miles) from his home. The walk took him about 10 hours and he had to make it at night. He never returned to the store. Needless to say, this sort of betrayed his older brother\u2019s expectations of him and it may have been difficult for him to return to the Hijikata house. It was at this point that he began to live most often at the Sato house. In 1851, at age 17 [16], he got another job at a shop that was a branch of the other Matsuzakaya. Because of his good looks, they made him sit near the storefront to attract customers into the shop. He was noted to have been very good with scissors. However this job did not last long either because he was caught messing around with a female co-worker and fired. He would later observe that he simply did not have the temperament to be a merchant. Sato scolded him over losing yet another job, but Hijikata quickly came up with a solution himself. He began to peddle the medicines made by the Hijikata and Sato families. On these trips he would carry his fencing equipment so that he could take lessons at the various dojo he stopped at while plying his trade. In this was he could earn money and still pursue his true interest and this time he was successful. He continued to do this until formally enrolling in the Shieikan in 1859. On November 6, 1861, Hijikata was at the Sato house when he became seriously ill. His brother Kasuya Ryojun (Daisaku) was called to attend to him and three days later the doctor son of another family acquaintance was brought in to check on him. Although it is unknown exactly what was wrong with him, he was dangerously sick and almost died. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Mokuroku Teacher - Kondo Shusuke, Shieikan dojo It is not certain exactly when Hijikata joined the Shieikan. Kojima Shikanosuke recorded that he entered the dojo at about age 17, but the school\u2019s records do not mention him. They do show that he was formally enrolled in 1859, at age 25 [24]. It may be that he was informally associated with the dojo before that time. Also, Hijikata does not appear to have ever earned a Menkyo (license) in Tennen Rishin Ryu. He is recorded as only have received a Mokuroku, the next to the lowest level. Despite his skill with a sword, all of the lessons he took at the dojo he visited while peddling medicine caused him to have the form of various sword styles mixed into his swordsmanship. It was said that Kondo Shusuke did not regard this mixed sword style as good and undoubtedly he would have been made to start all over again. Still, he was considered to be a formidable opponent and his enemies did not take him lightly. His Sword(s) - Long Sword - Izumi no Kami Fujiwara Kanesada - 2'8\" Short Sword - Kunihiro Horikawa - 1'11\"5 Toshizo\u2019s favorite blade was made by a swordsmith from Aizu. It is now on display in his family home in Ishida, where he is believed to have left it on his way to Kofu castle. His supposed short sword, the Kunihiro Horikawa, was a blade that was generally something only a daimyo or the like could afford. For this reason it is speculated that Hijikata\u2019s may have been a forgery. When they set out for Kyoto, Hijikata did not have a sword and had to borrow one. However it is recorded that by October of 1863 he was supposed to have already possessed both the Kanesada and Kunihiro Horikawa. Considering that the Kanesada was made by a swordsmith living in Aizu at that time, it is likely that the domain provided him with this blade. Shinsengumi Years - Started out in the Mibu Roshi as a Vice-commander along with Yamanami Keisuke. After Yamanami\u2019s death he continued to fill this role alone. On March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868] he became a high-ranking retainer of the Tokugawa. Later on he served as the Vice-commander of the army in the Republic of Ezo. Hijikata helped to form the Shinsengumi at age 29 [28] and is commonly thought to have been the soul of the group. But despite all of his contributions to their success, he never sought replace Kondo as the leader. Instead he tended to treat the Commander in the manner he would have an older brother. One of the items on display at the datahall in Ishida is a metal forehead protector that he wore during the political change on August 18, 1863 [September 30, 1863]. At this time the group became the Shinsengumi and began to gain some measure of respectability. Hijikata was of course delighted with the turnabout in their fortunes. When an old friend, Tomizawa Mashiro, visited the group in Kyoto, the Vice-commander entrusted this item to him and requested that he take it back to his family in Tama as a memento, along with a letter that he wrote them. Looking at it closely, one can see a small sword scar on the front of it, proving that this piece of equipment did its job on at least one occasion. Considering that the Shinsengumi did not actually fight on that day, the mark was either put there during another scuffle or it may have been a used piece of equipment and so was already scratched when it came to him. In his free time, Hijikata seems to have liked to play shogi (or go according to some) with Okita. It is remarked that all the other members would gather around to watch the game and that everyone seems to have enjoyed these matches very much. The battle of Toba-Fushimi would have a profound effect on Hijikata. Immediately after being defeated by western weapons, he decided to take the best of both the modern and the samurai world. He cut his long hair and began to dress in french clothing. He also began to carry a revolver as well as his sword. In this he serves as an example of what samurai may have become had the Meiji government not put an end to the warrior class. Not long after the defeat at Kofu, Kondo was captured and executed as a common criminal by the imperial army. This event left Hijikata consumed with guilt over his failure to save his friend and only strengthened his own resolve to fight to the death. He told others that he would be too embarrassed to face Kondo in the next life if he were to make peace with his enemies. It was at some point during this time period that the two pictures of him were likely taken. No one knows exactly when or where this occurred. Sendai is one possibility. Another is that at least one of the pictures was taken in a studio in Hakodate where many of the other members of the Republic of Ezo had their portraits taken. At least one of these pictures was sent by him to the Sato family through his page, Ichimura Tetsunosuke. On May 11, 1869 [June 20, 1869], the Meiji army began its invasion of Hakodate. Hijikata was unwilling to abandon members of the Shinsengumi who were guarding a fort called Benten Daiba. Instead of remaining at Goryokaku, he made a desperate attempt to get to the other fort and encountered enemy troops. He was killed on horseback by a bullet which struck him in the abdomen and shattered his lower back. He seems to have been dead before any of his men could arrive at his side. It is unknown where Hijikata was buried. Love Life - Women were naturally drawn to the exceptionally handsome Hijikata and there is little doubt that he was well aware of this and took full advantage of his looks. Kondo once wrote in a letter that the Vice-commander was bragging about his numerous women. In addition, many of the higher ranking members had more than one home in Kyoto where they kept their lovers. Hijikata was said to have been the worst offender in this regard. As mentioned before, he received many love letters from women in Kyoto. Another incident which shows the sort of reaction he commonly caused is told of the time the Shinsengumi spent in Goheishinden (now Adachi Ward, Tokyo) just after Kofu. Hijikata spent some of his time fishing in the river there, while still using the name \u201cNaito Hayato\u201d. No one in the area knew that he was actually Hijikata Toshizo of the Shinsengumi, so his reputation was not an influence on what happened next. Before long every girl in the village had gathered on the riverbank to watch the \u201chandsome samurai\u201d. It was agreed by all of them that he was \u201ca nice man\u201d. So just how bad was he when it came to the ladies? Even during the time he was at the Shieikan he was a regular visitor to Yoshiwara and had a woman there. In Kyoto there was a woman he would go to see in Shimabara, about three geisha in Gion, plus two or three more he would visit in Shimmachi pleasure quarters of Osaka. Also there was another woman who may have been named something like \u201cKotsuru\u201d or something to this effect. (The translator was not very clear on these names.) Yet another lover was a woman who may have been called something along the lines of \u201cOkiku\u201d. According to rumor she actually had a daughter by Hijikata, but the baby died soon after it was born. After this the woman said goodbye to him and married another man. It is said that she died very young. At first glance it is easy to get the impression that Hijikata was merely shallow when it came to women. However there was one relationship that he had before leaving Edo that proves otherwise. Before leaving for Kyoto, he was engaged to be married to a woman named Okoto. The arrangement had been made by his oldest brother, Tamejiro, who played the shamisen. Okoto\u2019s parents owned the shamisen shop that he often visited. Tamejiro introduced his brother to Okoto and their families urged them to marry at once. For his part, Hijikata seems to have been agreeable to the marriage. However he was already planning to join the Roshitai with Kondo and the others at that point and was reluctant to give up his dream now that he was so close. So he said to them, \u201cAfter winning a promotion, I want to carry out my marriage.\u201d Once in Kyoto, he continued to appear to be sincere in his intentions to marry Okoto. He sent her a present and later visited her when he returned to Edo for a brief visit. But the social situation in Kyoto proved to be far more unstable than they had anticipated and when he finally did receive the \u201cpromotion\u201d that he sought, he found that the Shinsengumi had put him in a position that would be dangerous for anyone involved with him. Hijikata felt that he had no choice but to cancel the engagement. Although he had many lovers afterwards, he never again came close to making a commitment to any of them. This would actually become the general policy of the Shinsengumi. Though there were exceptions to the rule, for the most part married men and family heirs would be discouraged from joining the group. The risks were simply too great. By the time Hijikata went to Ezo, he was avoiding women altogether. As far as anyone knows, he had no children. Translation of the Inscription on the Portrait by Nakajima Nobori- \u201cHijikata was a man of great talent and integrity. In his later years, he became so gentle that people sought him in the way a baby seeks his mother. On the eleventh day of the fifth month of Meiji 2 (1869), during the Hakodate Battle, he fought like a fierce tiger chasing after a helpless flock of fleeing lambs. Taking several of his men, he forcefully headed into battle and was killed on his horse by a sniper. He was a great and noble man of his time.\u201d (Source: sites.google.com ) hijikata bio shinsengumi no makoto hakodate shinsengumi shinsengumi vice commander ikedaya toba fushimi kinmon kia kia at hakodate mia edo hino kyoto ezo shieikan tennen rishin ryu battle of hakodate boshin war friend of kondo love story kofu hijikata family serizawa assassination itou assassination", "title": "Hijikata Toshizo [shinsengumi-no-makoto]", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188360350941/hijikata-toshizo-shinsengumi-no-makoto"}, "188380261491": {"html": "<div id=\"post-188380261491\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\r\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\r\n                        <!--\r\n                            <div class=\"type\">\r\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380261491/the-japanese-english-bilingual-corpus-of\">Text</a>\r\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\r\n                            \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\r\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- .date -->\r\n                        <!--\r\n                            <div class=\"date\">\r\n                                October 16, 2019\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        -->\r\n                        \r\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380261491/the-japanese-english-bilingual-corpus-of\">The Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia\u2019s Kyoto Articles - What?

Why? How? hakuouki-history : Yesterday, I posted a translation of the 2010 Japanese wikipedia article about Hijikata Toshizo. I explained it came from the Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia\u2019s Kyoto Articles . Now, there\u2019s a mouthful. Today\u2019s post is going to explain the nuts and bolts of using this resource. For a while now, I had noticed that when you googled Japanese historical names in English, you would often get hits from the Japanee English-learning website, Weblio. These hits would be translated sentences from Japanese Wikipedia. There were enough of them, and they were translated so well, that I realized someone somewhere had translated entire Wikipedia articles. And yet I couldn\u2019t find the actual articles by googling. I did, however, find the articles. They are not, at the moment, in an easily accessible format. I hope that\u2019ll change. But they are accessible to anyone and i\u2019ll explain how to get the most out of them. First, though, what is this bilingual corpus? It\u2019s 14,111 English translations of Japanese Wikipedia articles from 2010 related to Kyoto. Keep reading I wrote a program to format the articles in a human-readable way.

[shinsengumi-no-makoto] Captain of the Tenth Unit Born - 1840 in Iyo Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku. [Midori-cho, Matsuyama, Ehime] Died - May 17, 1868 in Honjo, Sarue, Edo at age 29. [July 6, 1868 in Tokyo at age 28.] Names - Imina - Tadakazu Physical Description - Harada is simply described as a tall, handsome man. He had a seppuku scar that began on his left side and ran across his stomach. Personality Quirks and Traits - He was a short-tempered, restless, and rash individual who often disobeyed his superiors. He displayed some cleverness at reading and writing as a youth. When he would get drunk he would show off his seppuku scar and brag about being \u201cindestructible\u201d. Harada also changed his crest to a circle with one line through it to reflect his attempt at seppuku. He was the only man among the executive officers of the group to marry and was a considerate and devoted husband. Family History - Harada was the second son of a lower samurai of the Iyo Matsuyama feudal clan. In March of 1865 he married a woman named Masa. She was the second daughter of a merchant family named Sugawara. Their first son was born in 1866. Their second son was born in December of 1867, but the child died eight days later. Before the Shinsengumi - In 1855 Harada went to Edo in the service of the Naitos family and worked as a \u201cmaintenance man\u201d in the daimyo\u2019s second residence in that city. He was about 15 at that time. In 1857 he returned home and became a lesser retainer. It was during this period that he tried to commit seppuku over a trifle. Apparently he got into an altercation with some men of higher rank who told him that he would not even be able to kill himself correctly. In his anger Harada tried to prove them wrong and cut himself. However the wound was slight and he survived. Martial Skills - Spear Ryu - Taneda Houzouin Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Tani Sanjuro Harada apparently trained in the spear under Tani as his dojo in Osaka. Shinsengumi Years - Harada was with the group when the Mibu Roshi first formed and became a captain. He maintained this position until after the battle at Kofu, when he left with Nagakura. At the group\u2019s height he was Captain of the Tenth Unit. Like Nagakura, Harada seems to have butted heads with Kondo on occasion. He was one of the members who filed the petition against the commander. Later he left the group with the second captain in April of 1867. Shortly after this he parted ways with Nagakura and joined the Shogitai, who were then in Ueno, Edo to guard the Shogun. Harada was shot in the back during their battle with the Meiji government and passed away two days later on May 17, 1867 [July 6, 1867] at the age of 29 [28]. There are some who believe an alternate story, which claims that Harada became a bandit in Manchuria. According to this theory, he never joined the Shogitai and fled through Niigata to China, where he became the boss of mounted bandits and acted \u201cviolently\u201d. This theory seems to be based on an encounter some Japanese soldiers had during the Sino-Japanese War (about 1894) with a man who may have been with the Shinsengumi. This person knew a lot about the group that was not supposed to be generally known, but there is no real proof that he was indeed Harada.

Genzaburo [shinsengumi-no-makoto] Captain of the Sixth Unit Born - March 1, 1829 in Tama, Musashi. [April 4, 1829 - Tokyo prefecture(?)] Died - January 4, 1868 in the Senbonmatsu area of Yodo, outside of Kyoto at age 39. [January 28, 1868 at age 37.] Names - Imina - Kazushige Personality Traits and Quirks - Inoue was a gentle, warmhearted man and his good nature made him popular with the younger members of the group. However he could be very stubborn at times and if he ever took a position on something then no amount of persuasion was going to budge him. He was also a taciturn individual and faithful till the end. It is said he was very friendly with Okita. Family History - Inoue was the third son of Inoue Matsugoro, the leader of a group known as the Hachioji Sennin Doushin. The group was made up of families who had once been retainers of the Takeda clan. After their leaders were defeated, the head of the Inoue family had made some bargain with the Tokugawa. While they did not become retainers, they were at the clan\u2019s service as warriors. The other part of their income came from farming. It appears that it was the second son of the family who succeeded their father. He changed his name from Matsujiro to Matsugoro at this time. At the time the Shinsengumi first formed in Kyoto as the Mibu Roshi, he was in Kyoto with the Hachioji Sennin Doushin to provide security for the Shogun and his retainers. While there Matsugoro took part in various activities with members of the Shinsengumi. However he returned home soon after the Shogun\u2019s business was concluded in the capitol. Inoue was also somehow related to Inoue Rintaro, who became Okita Rintaro and was the brother-in-law of Okita Soji. This connection seems to be how Okita most likely ended up at the Shieikan. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Mokuroku Teacher - Kondo Shusuke and Kondo Isami, Shieikan dojo Along with his father and brothers, Inoue was initiated into the Shieikan by Kondo Shusuke in 1847. He was very eager to learn swordsmanship and is said to have become negligent in farming. There are some who think that he actually did reach the rank of Menkyo Kaiden in 1860, but he is generally shown as having the same lower rank as Hijikata. Shinsengumi Years - Inoue was part of the group who formed the Mibu Roshi and was a captain throughout their years in Kyoto. At the group\u2019s height, he was Captain of the Sixth Unit. At the battle of Toba-Fushimi, Inoue is said to have faithfully followed Hijikata\u2019s orders. He fought without being daunted by the superior firepower that they faced. In the Senbonmatsu area of Yodo, he was shot in the abdomen and killed. His nephew is said to have buried his head and sword at a nearby temple.

Advisor Born - 1835 in Chiyoda, Hitachi, Shizuki. Died - November 18, 1867 in Kyoto at age 33. [December 18, 1867 at age 32.] Names - Imina - Takeaki Childhood Name - Suzuki Okura Alternate Names - Ito Okura, Ito Settsu Ito was born into the Suzuki family. He later took the name of his kenjutsu teacher when he married the man\u2019s daughter and inherited the dojo. Still later he took the name \u201cSettsu\u201d at the time when he departed from the Shinsengumi. Physical Description - He is described as a very handsome man and is said to have been a graceful figure. People would stop to stare when he walked through Gion. Personality Quirks and Traits - Ito was a highly cultured and educated man. He supposedly had a mild character and liked to wear black. Family History - Ito\u2019s father may have been named Ito Tadaaki. He appears to have made some critical error which brought him into conflict with domain officials. To spare his family trouble, he tried to leave them. It appears that his father owed a debt of some sort, which Ito tried to raise the money to repay. However the whole family ended up expelled from the domain and their surname was stripped from them. The family then moved to a village called Sakuramura and stayed with one Sakurai Shirouseamon for a time. Later they were allowed to have their family name back, but could not return to their home domain. Their father opened a school which taught Chinese classics. Because Ito had already moved away at the time of his death in 1852 at age 48, his younger brother Suzuki Mikisaburo inherited the school. However Suzuki was only about 16 [15] at the time and the school soon failed. Aside from the younger brother, Ito had two sisters. His elder sister was named Koto and the younger sister was named Suma. Before the Shinsengumi - After leaving his family, Ito moved to Mito and studied at the dojo of a friend who taught Shintou Munen Ryu. He also studied Mito learning and royalism thought while there. It was most likely at some point during this time that Ito became involved with the notorious Tengu-to. By March of 1864 the Tengu-to were headed for open conflict with the Tokugawa authorities. It was at this point that Ito followed the advice of an \u201cold friend\u201d and gave up support of the group. It turned out to be a good call. Fighting broke out in July and continued through December, when the group was finally forced to surrender. By that point Ito was already safely in Kyoto by the invitation of the Shinsengumi. Martial Skills - Ryu - Shintou Munen Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Ryu - Hokushin Itto Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Ito Seiichiro At some point while he was still with the Tengu-to, Ito moved to Edo and continued his studies at the dojo of Ito Seiichiro in the Fukagawa, Saga area. In 1861 he was the leading student of the dojo. That same year he married his teacher\u2019s daughter, Ume. After Seiichiro died, he inherited the dojo and changed his name from \u201cSuzuki Okura\u201d to \u201cIto Okura\u201d. Ito was known to be well versed in western studies, a skill which made him very valuable to the Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi Years - Ito joined the Shinsengumi on October 15, 1864 [November 14, 1864], when Kondo and Todo visited Edo. He appears to have served very briefly as a captain, but quickly took over Takeda Kanryuusai\u2019s former role due to his knowledge of western military arts. He maintained this position until his departure in March of 1867. At the group\u2019s height, Ito was the Military Advisor. It was on the occasion of his joining the Shinsengumi that he took the name \u201cIto Kashitaro\u201d. Todo appears to have sent the invitation in September, so he had plenty of time to make his plans before they arrived. It seems odd that someone who was a devoted loyalist would join the Shinsengumi, which is why many suspect that Ito\u2019s true reason for becoming a member of the group was to subvert them to this cause. Ito must have got along well with Yamanami. Both were educated men and practiced the same ryu. It is also said that both of them had loyalist views. Upon Yamanami\u2019s death, Ito wrote several poems in his honor. It should be noted that Yamanami\u2019s death was not the immediate cause of Ito\u2019s departure from the group, as some would suggest. If Yamanami\u2019s death was indeed forced seppuku, then it most certainly would have influenced his opinions about the group and how he dealt with some of the other members, but it would be over two more years before he actually broke ties with them. According to rumor, things did not go so smoothly with the other Vice-commander right from the start. Hijikata is said to have disliked the newcomer. At the very least it is suggested that he became suspicious of Ito\u2019s true motives for being with the group at some point. Eventually Ito seems to have given up influencing the Shinsengumi while Kondo and Hijikata were still in charge. He asked permission to leave the group as early as September 26,1866, at the house of Kondo\u2019s mistress. Hijikata and Shinohara Tainoshin were also there and the four men got into a very heated argument, with Kondo and Hijikata refusing to give permission in the end. Soon after Ito found an excuse to go to Kyushu, where he met with Nakaoka Shintaro, Sakamoto Ryoma\u2019s friend, and some of the court nobles exiled during the August 18, 1863 political change. It was through their aid that Ito was able to secure the imperial orders that would allow him to break away from the Shinsengumi on March 20, 1867 [April 24, 1867].. At the time that he left the group to take up his position \u201cguarding the imperial tomb\u201d of the recently deceased Emperor Komei, Ito took the name \u201cIto Settsu\u201d, apparently with imperial permission. For a while he pretended to maintain friendly relations with the Shinsengumi, but secretly he was already meeting with members of the Satsuma clan. However Kondo and Hijikata were not fooled. Although the imperial orders kept them from moving against Ito for the moment, they were patiently watching and waiting for him to make his mistake. Some say they had the aid of a spy within his ranks, Saito Hajime, to give them their opportunity. Things began to fall apart for Ito around the 10 th of November. He had made plans to assassinate Kondo on the 20 th , but then Saito suddenly bailed out on the group. He secretly went back to the Shinsengumi and informed them of what Ito was planning. Kondo immediately ordered Ito\u2019s death. During the meantime, Ito may have played a part in the murder of Sakamoto Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintaro. Whether he had an actual hand in the killing is debatable, but he certainly played some part in framing the Shinsengumi for the crime. Just two days before he \u201cwarned\u201d Sakamoto that the group was after his life. This was obviously a false piece of information since Kondo was in close contact with Nagai Naomune and must have been aware that Sakamoto was the one behind the Tosa proposal that would have allowed the Tokugawa to surrender power to the Emperor, while retaining their lands and having a say in the new government which would form. Ito also helpfully identified a sword sheath \u201cfound\u201d at the scene as belonging to Harada Sanosuke. It was this \u201ccrime\u201d for which Kondo was later executed. On November 18, 1867 [December 13, 1867], Kondo invited Ito to the house of his mistress for dinner. Hijikata was also there. Against the advice of his followers, Ito attended. Things seemed to go well, but on his way home he found Shinsengumi members lying in wait for him. Oishi Kuwajiro stabbed him in the throat with a spear, mortally wounding him. Ito then fought his way to a near-by temple, where he finished himself by committing seppuku. He was 33 [32] years old. Ito was first buried at Kouen-ji Temple. After the Boshin War, his body was transferred to Higashiyama-kaikouji Temple, along with the remains of those who died with him that night. Love Life - Ito was originally married to the daughter of his kenjutsu teacher, Ito Ume, in 1861. She was completely opposed to his going to Kyoto. Soon after his departure, she wrote a letter claiming that his mother was ill. Ito came home at once, but on finding out she had lied, he immediately divorced her and returned to Kyoto. He was known to have at least two or three mistresses in Kyoto. One of them bore him a son.

Chuuji (Tadaji) [shinsengumi-no-makoto] Captain of the Fourth Unit Born - Unknown Died - September of 1865 [October 20, 1865] in Mibu, Kyoto. Names - Imina - Nobutada Physical Description - Matsubara had a shaved head and for this reason there are some who think he may have started out as a Buddhist priest. He was known to wrap a white bandanna around his head. Personality Quirks and Traits - He is described as a \u201cnoisy\u201d person. Family History - He is said to have been the son of an Ono clansman from the Harima area. Nagakura however seems to have thought he was from Osaka. Martial Skills - He was an expert in Sekiguchi Ryu, a style of jujutsu. He was also known for his naginata (Japanese halberd). Shinsengumi Years - Matsubara joined the group sometime in 1863 and was a captain up until around the time of his death in 1865. It is said that he was demoted just before he died. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was the Captain of the Fourth Unit and a teacher of jujutsu. He seems to be primarily to be remembered for a love affair that he had which seems to have brought him into conflict with Hijikata. The story goes that one night in the summer of 1865, Matsubara went to Gion and became very intoxicated. On his way back to headquarters he got into a quarrel with a Kii roshi who possibly had the surname of \u201cAnzai\u201d. He ended up killing the man. Later on he began to sober up and started to feel guilty over what had happened. He decided to take the man\u2019s body to back to the family. However when he found them, he found that the roshi had a wife and a sick child. The family appears to have been very poor and their home was in a slum area of Mibu down a back alley. Of course this made him feel even worse and he could not bring himself to tell that what had occurred, so he began to simply take care of them. Eventually he developed very deep feelings for the widow. Eventually news of this got back to Hijikata, who was not happy about him taking up with a \u201cmarried woman\u201d at all. It also appears that the two of them may not have gotten along very well in general. In any event it created a very strained situation and it may have even caused Matsubara to be demoted. In order to try and set things right, Matsubara attempted to commit seppuku. However he ended up narrowly missing death. There are two versions of what happened next. The more \u201cromantic\u201d of the two is that Matsubara and the widow decided to commit suicide together when the seppuku wound suddenly became aggravated. The story of their death became famous as the \u201cMibu Double-suicide\u201d. But it would appear that this version of events is just that - a story. The other, and probably true version, of what happened to Matsubara is that he died when the seppuku wound became infected. Such a thing would not have been uncommon at that time. As for why someone would make up a tale about him and the widow dying together, the answer is that such stories were considered to be very romantic at that time.
