group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He served as a shogunate retainer in his later years. Isami was his nickname, and his real name was Masayoshi. His family crest was the Marunimitsubiki (a circle with three straight parallel lines laid horizontally inside). Joining the Shieikan Dojo He was born the third son of a farmer called Kyujiro MIYAGAWA. His childhood name was Katsugoro. In addition to Katsugoro, the Miyagawa family included a daughter Rie (who died two years before Isami KONDO&#8217;s birth), the oldest son Otogoro MIYAGAWA, and the second son Kumejiro MIYAGAWA. He was from Kamiishihara Village, Tama district, Musashi Province, which is currently (in the northwestern part of) Nomizu, Chofu City, Tokyo. His birthplace was torn down in the Chofu Airport expansion work during the war. On December 6, 1849, Kondo joined the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing dojo (hall used for martial arts training) called the Shieikan Dojo. He was recognized by Shusuke KONDO (Shusai KONDO) for killing thieves, and this led him to become an adopted son of the Shimazaki family where Shusuke was from, and he then called himself Katsuta SHIMAZAKI. Afterwards, he was officially adopted by the Kondo family; therefore, he first called himself Isami SHIMAZAKI but later began calling himself Isami KONDO. In 1860, he married Tsune MATSUI, the oldest daughter of Yasogoro MATSUI, who was serving the Shimizu family. In September of the next year, he had an exhibition match at the Okunitama-jinja Shrine in Fuchu City, Tokyo, to announce his succession as the fourth head of the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing originator family, and as he officially became the successor of the family, he became heavily responsible for it. In 1862, his first daughter, Tama KONDO, was born. In 1863, accepting Hachiro KIYOKAWA&#8217;s suggestion, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) recruited participants of the &#8216;Roshigumi (Ronin Corps),&#8217; which was an organization consisting of ronin, or lordless samurai, for guarding the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA on the way to the capital. The eight members of the Shieikan Dojo other than Hajime SAITO decided to join, and on March 26, they left for Kyoto with other Roshigumi members. The party arrived in Kyoto on April 10 after proceeding down Nakasendo Road, and Mibugoshi (Mibu samurai) Gennojo YAGI kindly let them stay at his residence. Becoming the head of Shinsengumi Kiyokawa suggested to the Imperial Court that the Roshigumi return to Edo (the old name of Tokyo), by submitting a petition. 24 members, including Kondo and Kamo SERIZAWA, who was a samurai from the Mito domain, opposed the idea of returning to Edo remained in Kyoto. He submitted a petition to Katamori MATSUDAIRA, who was the head of the Aizu domain in the Kyoto Shugo Shoku post (the deputy of Kyoto), such that they could call themselves the \\'Mibu Roshigumi&#8217; and start their own activities under the control of the Kyoto Shugo Shoku. Mibu Roshigumi did not operate smoothly after its establishment, and on May 12, one of the initial members of Mibu Roshigumi, Yoshio TONOUCHI, died there (there has been an assassination theory). Members of the Yuzan NEGISHI faction and Shingoro KASUYA left the organization, Eizaburo ABIRU died of illness (there has been an assassination theory), and Jiro IESATO killed himself. As a result, Mibu Roshigumi consisted of two factions, the Kondo and Serizawa factions. When the coup of August 18 led by Imperial prince Nakagawa no miya Asahiko, the Aizu domain, and the Satsuma domain occurred for the purpose of removing the Choshu domain from the politics in Kyoto, Mibu Roshigumi was appointed to guard the Ohanabatake-mon Gate. Their performance was then recognized and the organization was given a new troop name of \\'Shinsengumi&#8217; by the Buketenso (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the court). When the members of the Serizawa factions were assassinated on October 28 (or 30) of the same year, a new organization system was established under the leadership of Isami KONDO. In July, 1864, Shinsengumi captured Shuntaro FURUTAKA who was an ally of Teizo MIYABE of the Kumamoto domain. Knowing from the statement of Shuntaro FURUTAKA that there was a plan to set fire to the Nakagawanomiya-tei Imperial house, the Shinsengumi immediately started to search for the Miyabe faction, committed the Ikedaya Incident, and destroyed the faction. For this, Shinsengumi received a commendation and an award from both the Imperial Court and the bakufu. After fighting in the Kinmon Incident, Isami KONDO returned home to recruit new members. He then successfully recruited new members, including Kashitaro ITO. In 1865, he left for Hiroshima to serve as Naoyuki NAGAI&#8217;s squire. In 1867, the entire Shinsengumi became a shogunate vassal, and Isami KONDO held rank as the vassal with the privilege to have an audience with the shogun. This promotion allowed Isami KONDO to carry out negotiations with important individuals as one of the bakufu representatives, and Shojiro GOTO, who was a politician from the Tosa domain, was one of the examples. Meanwhile, Kashitaro ITO parted from the organization as a Goryo Eji (Guard of an Emperor&#8217;s Tomb), in which Heisuke TODO and Hajime SAITO (a spy belonging to the Kondo faction) also joined. Ito planned to assassinate Kondo (there has been a theory however that Ito never thought about assassinating Kondo), but instead, on December 13 of the same year, Kondo made Ito drunk and ordered Kuwajiro OISHI to assassinate Ito on his way home. Then, he invited other Goryo Eji out, made a nighttime assault on them, and killed Todo and others. In retaliation for that assault, Kondo was shot and injured by the remaining members of Goryo Eji on Fushimi-kaido Road on January 12, 1868. He therefore could not lead the troop in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 27, 1868, and healed himself in Osaka-jo Castle. Ryojun MATSUMOTO, who was a bakufu teni (bakufu doctor) as well as a medical examiner of Shinsengumi, treated Kondo. The Boshin War The Shinsengumi returned to Edo by a bakufu battleship after losing the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. When he visited Ryojun MATSUMOTO at his residence after returning to Edo, a photographer, Kuichi UCHIDA, who happened to be there took pictures of him and two of them still exist. It is said that in one of the pictures he leaned a little bit because his right shoulder had been injured. In March, following the bakufu order, Kondo renamed himself Takeshi OKUBO, restructured the troop as the Koyo Chinbutai troop, and led the troop to Kofu for service, but the troop lost to the new government force in the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma and he was routed, and at the same time, Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Sanosuke HARADA left the troop because of conflicts of opinion. He then renamed himself again, taking the name Yamato OKUBO, recruited former bakufu infantry in the Goheishinden district (currently Adachi Ward, Tokyo), and met them in the Nagareyama District, Shimosa Province (currently Nagareyama City, Chiba Prefecture) in April; however, they were surrounded by the new government force and he surrendered to the government force headquarters in the Koshigaya District (currently Koshigaya City, Saitama Prefecture). Someone in the government force knew that Okubo used to be Kondo; therefore, he was taken to Itabashi-shuku (the first shukuba (inn town) from Edo on Nakasendo Road) where the government-general office was. Although Kondo insisted that he was Okubo, Washio KANO, a former Shinsengumi member as well as one of the Goryo Eji, found that he really was Kondo, and this led to him being captured. Then, there was a disagreement between the Tosa and Satsuma domains over how Kondo should be treated, but in the end, on May 17, he was beheaded at the Hiraoichirizuka mound (currently the Takino-gawa River, Kita Ward, Tokyo). He was 35 years old. His head was exhibited in Itabashi, the Sennichimae area in Osaka, and the Sanjo-gawara Riverside in Kyoto. It is not certain where the head went afterwards. Grave It has been believed that the high priest of the Higashi-Hongan-ji Temple received and buried Kondo&#8217;s remains, but there is another theory that his comrades took the body back and buried it at Hozo-ji Temple in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, and there is in fact a mound for Kondo&#8217;s head at this temple. There are also his graves built by his former comrade Shinpachi NAGAKURA at the Ryugen-ji Temple in Mitaka City, Tokyo (quite close to the present Nomizu, Chofu City, where he was from as described above) and in front of the JR Itabashi Station which is close to an execution ground. There is a grave at the Tennei-ji Temple in Aizuwakamatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture, where part of his body was supposedly buried by Toshizo HIJIKATA, and there is also a grave at the Kokoku-ji Temple in Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, where a cousin of Isami KONDO, Kintaro KONDO, is reported to have secretly taken the head back and buried it. In Nagareyama City and Aizuwakamatsu City, the \\'Anniversary for Isami KONDO&#8217;s Death&#8217; is celebrated every year for his soul. His descendents in Tokyo have been farmers for generations, and the present descendents are also farmers there. Also, one of his descendents, Seizo MIYAGAWA, became the ninth head of the Tennenrishin-ryu school fencing originator family (Isami KONDO was the fourth head). His posthumous Buddhist name was Kantenindenjungiseichudaikoji. His words of wisdom He was featured in the NHK historical drama \\'Shinsengumi!&#8217; by Japan Broadcasting Corporation. The source of the statement below about the poor insight was &#8217; &#8217; of the Shusui edition of &#8220;Soshi&#8221; written by Soshi, and the source of the highlighted part is unknown. The frog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean. But it knows the height of the sky.

The name (currently unavailable) contained the elements &#8220;inden&#8221;\\nand &#8220;daikoji&#8221;, which are usually reserved for the social elite. Because he was originally a farmer,\\nKondo normally would not have qualified for such a name and so it was a huge honor.

Although there is\\nnot an exact estimate of his height, he was not an extremely tall man.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [November 9, 1834 in Kamiishihara, Chofu, Tokyo.] Died - April 25, 1868 in Itabashi, Musashi at age 35. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [May 17, 1868 in Itabashi, Tokyo at age 34.] Names - Imina - Masanobu (Masayoshi) Childhood Name - Miyagawa Katsugoro Alternate Name - Okubo Yamato Kondo briefly took the name &#8220;Okubo Yamato&#8221; on March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868] when he was\\nmade a Junior Councilor. It was the name he was using at the time the imperial army arrested\\nhim. Matsudaira Katamori created a &#8220;kaimyo&#8221; or &#8220;Buddhist death name&#8221; for him at the time Hijikata\\nbuilt a grave for him in Aizu. The name (currently unavailable) contained the elements &#8220;inden&#8221;\\nand &#8220;daikoji&#8221;, which are usually reserved for the social elite. Because he was originally a farmer,\\nKondo normally would not have qualified for such a name and so it was a huge honor. It can be\\nconsidered a small example of Matsudaira&#8217;s thankfulness to the Shinsengumi for their long years\\nof support. Physical Description - It is said that Kondo had a &#8220;rustic&#8221; face, but was still attractive enough that women surrounded\\nhim. He is also noted to have dimples when he would smile. His mouth was very wide and his\\nentire fist could be fit inside. He had a very powerful build and a sharp gaze. Although there is\\nnot an exact estimate of his height, he was not an extremely tall man. Rumor has it that his\\ntopknot only came even with Hijikata&#8217;s chin if they stood next to each other. Personality Quirks and Traits - Kondo seems to have enjoyed entertaining others by showing them how he could put his fist in\\nhis mouth. He was also said to have pulled the same trick with his favorite food, manju (steamed\\ndumpling). In personality he was a simple, honest man of traditional values. Many noted his kindness and\\ngenerosity. No one ever saw Kondo drunk. He often borrowed books from Kojima Shikanosuke\\nwhile he was still in Tama and he spent much of his spare time reading in the final days before\\nhis arrest. As a leader he was a capable man who had a sense of authority about him and a rather\\nmartial attitude. He was always very serious when on duty, though he could be very friendly at\\nother times. Although he was a good person overall, Kondo sometimes took too much pride in the\\nShinsengumi&#8217;s success. Even Hijikata warned him about this on occasion. There were some who\\naccused him of being arrogant and things got so bad at one point that Nagakura Shinpachi led\\nothers in filing a petition to Aizu against him. Whatever tensions may have existed between himself and the rest of the Shinsengumi however,\\nKondo was always well respected by them and they honored his memory after his death. Family History - Kondo was the third son of a powerful farmer named Miyagawa Kyujiro. His mother, Miyo,\\npassed away when he was only about four or five. She seems to have been only around 38 at the\\ntime. He had two older brothers and the eldest was named Otogoro. He also appears to have had\\nboth an older and younger sister, but both of them died very young. Incidently, the Miyagawa house is no longer standing. It was demolished during World War II\\n(1943) so that a nearby military airbase could extend their runways. On October 19, 1849 [December 8, 1849], he was adopted by Kondo Shusuke at the age of 16\\n[15]. Shusuke&#8217;s wife was named Fude. According to some stories, Kondo met several women before he took a wife. He supposedly\\nchoose the first woman with an appearance that was not very good. His reason was said to have\\nbeen that a beautiful woman would be a nuisance around the dojo because she would be a\\ndistraction to the men. Of course another story has it that he was forced to marry. He married Matsui Tsune on March 29, 1860 [April 19, 1860] at age 27 [26]. She was the eldest\\ndaughter of Matsui Yasogora, a vassal of a Hitotsubashi house who served a man named\\nShimizu. Their only child was a daughter named Tamako (or Tama according to some), who was\\nborn in 1862. Kondo was good friends with another Tama resident named Kojima Shikanosuke. Just before he\\nleft for Kyoto, the two became sworn brothers. His nephew, Miyagawa Yugoro, later followed him into the Shinsengumi. Yugoro was his elder\\nbrother&#8217;s son. After Kondo was executed, Yugoro is thought to have retrieved his body for\\nproper burial. Later on he married Tamako, taking on the Kondo name and inheriting his uncle&#8217;s\\ndojo. Unfortunately the couple had no children and Tamako died of illness while still very young.\\nYugoro later remarried. Another nephew, Miyagawa Shinkichi, joined the Shinsengumi in 1865 when they came to\\nrecruit in the Edo area. He died in action at Tenma-ya and is buried at the same temple as Kondo. Kondo&#8217;s brother-in-law, Matsui Tokutaro, may have also been in the group. Before the Shinsengumi - Kondo is described as having been a good kid who did not need to be scolded very often. His\\nfather was a lover of war tales and often told him heroic stories that would later have a profound\\ninfluence on how he conducted the Shinsengumi. He apparently had trouble with some of the older kids every once in a while. One story has it that\\nhe took revenge on someone who was harassing him by climbing a tree, then peeing on the\\nperson when he passed underneath. On another occasion two youths tried to bully him, but they\\ngave up in disgust when they could not force him to cry. Kondo himself was never cruel to\\nyounger children and when he would steal persimmons he would divide any leftovers up among\\nthem. Sometime after joining the Shieikan, an intruder broke into the Miyagawa home and tried to take\\nsome valuable item. Kondo took the lead even though he was the youngest. The brothers\\nambushed the thief when he was on his way out and caused him to drop the object he was trying\\nto steal. When his brother would have gone in pursuit of the man, Kondo stopped him by\\npointing out that they had the item back and pursuit would be dangerous. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Tennen Rishin Ryu Shihan (Teacher) Teacher - Kondo Shusuke, Shieikan dojo [Ichigaya, Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo] Along with his two brothers, Kondo became a disciple of Tennen Rishin Ryu on November 11,\\n1848 [December 6, 1848] at age 15 [14]. &#160;He was very enthusiastic about practicing and learned\\nquickly. Kondo Shusuke soon noted both his skill and temperament. After hearing about the\\nincident with the thief from their father, Shusuke was sufficiently impressed to make the boy his\\nsuccessor. Miyagawa Katsugoro was adopted into the Kondo family on October 19, 1849 and took the name\\nKondo Isami. By August 27, 1861 [October 1, 1861] a field match was held at Yasaka Shrine to\\ncelebrate his succession to the head of the Shieikan dojo, making him the fourth generation\\nmaster of the school. Teaching had never been limited to just the dojo. Kondo traveled throughout the countryside to\\ngive lessons. Both Kojima Shikanosuke and Sato Hikogoro had dojo in their homes for this\\npurpose and it was on one of these visits that he first met Hijikata Toshizo. The two soon formed\\na friendship that would last for the rest of their lives. Swordsmanship was not the only thing taught at the Shieikan. Kojima Shikanosuke was known\\nto come there to teach calligraphy to the students. There also seems to be mention of spear and\\njujutsu being taught as well. Kondo had a black training robe with a human skull embroidered in white on the back. It was\\nsaid he wore this to show his determination as a swordsman. The jacket is now on display at the\\nKojima house. His favorite technique was called &#8220;Ryubi no Ken&#8221;. (&#8220;A dragon attacks with his tail when his head\\nis attacked and attacks with his head when his tail is attacked.&#8221;) When an opponent raised his\\nsword in the &#8220;jodan&#8221; stance (an offensive position), Kondo would lower the tip of his in the\\n&#8220;gedan&#8221; stance (a defensive position with the sword point toward the other person&#8217;s knees) and\\nturn his body to stay in &#8220;hanmi&#8221; (a position where the body is turned sideways in relation to the\\nfoe&#8217;s). When his opponent attacked, he would quickly raise his own sword to either break the\\nother person&#8217;s blade or deflect the slash, then use the same momentum to immediately inflict a\\ndownwards stroke while they were unprotected. His Sword(s)- Long Sword - Nagasone Kotetsu - 2\\'3\"5 Legend has it that Kondo owned a blade made by Kotetsu, one of the thirty-one greatest\\nswordsmiths, who lived during the 17 th century. The story goes that he stopped a robber at the\\nfamous Konoike shop in Osaka. In gratitude, the owner gave the sword to Kondo as a gift. However Kotetsu&#8217;s blades were sought after because they were known to perform well in\\n&#8220;tameshigiri&#8221; tests. This was a process where cutting ability was tested on a human corpse,\\nusually a criminal&#8217;s. The results would be inscribed onto the blade, but these could easily be\\nforged. And even during Kotetsu&#8217;s lifetime people were making swords that they then attributed\\nto him in order to charge a higher price. According to Saito Hajime, Kondo&#8217;s sword was just such a forgery. As he told others years later,\\nhe himself had bought the blade at a secondhand shop called the Yotsuya because Kondo thought\\nit resembled a Kotetsu. Saito gave it to him in order to thank him for lessons that he had received\\nat the Shieikan, which incidently confirms that he was associated with the group long before they\\nwent to Kyoto. Even though he was well aware from the start that it was a fake, Kondo was very\\nhappy with the sword. As Saito described it, the blade had some sort of sculpture on the guard.\\nThere was also some sort of inscription (possibly a forged tameshigiri result) which had long\\nbefore worn away. There are a few who say that Kondo owned another sword called the Kiyomaru. This swordsmith\\nwas making blades around the time of the Bakumatsu. Shinsengumi Years - Was one of three Commanders of the &#8220;Mibu Roshi&#8221; when the group first formed in Mibu. Later\\nhe became the sole Commander of the group when Serizawa Kamo and others were eliminated. He had originally joined the &#8220;Roshitai&#8221; in hopes of becoming a samurai in the service of the\\nShogun. This wish came true in June of 1867 when the Shinsengumi became direct retainers of\\nthe Tokugawa. Kondo himself had the right to directly meet with the Shogun. On March 1, 1868\\n[March 24, 1868] he was appointed to the &#8220;Wakatoshiyori&#8221; or &#8220;Junior Council&#8221;, which\\nadministered the Tokugawa&#8217;s personal domains. It was on this occasion that he was given the\\nname &#8220;Okubo Yamato&#8221;. Unfortunately his success came only when the shogunate was already\\ncrumbling. Kondo had been injured in December of 1867 when the remaining followers of Ito Kashitaro\\nmade an attempt on his life. The wound was in his right shoulder and continued to plague him for\\nthe few remaining months of his life. After Toba-Fushimi, he visited Matsumoto Ryojun in Edo\\nand the doctor removed bone fragments which were still in the wound a month later. When he\\nwent to Kofu he had to travel in a palanquin and could not raise his arm above chest level.\\nFollowing the battle, Hijikata had to rush him back to Edo for medical treatment because the\\ninjury had taken a turn for the worse. This proved to be a contributing factor in the falling out he\\nhad with Nagakura and Harada, since many of the group were angry they could not find their\\nleader in a time of crisis and the two men had been forced to take steps to calm everyone down. He was captured on April 3, 1868 [April 25, 1868] and taken to Itabashi. A short time later, on\\nApril 25, 1868 [May 17, 1868], he was beheaded as a common criminal rather than being\\nallowed to commit seppuku. He faced his death with great dignity and courage. His head was\\nplaced on public display in Edo. On April 8, 1868 [May 29, 1868] his head was taken to Kyoto\\nand displayed at the Sanjo bridge. (No that is not a mistype. The lunar calendar sometimes\\nrequired that a month be repeated in order to keep it in synch with the solar year.) Today the exact location of Kondo&#8217;s remains are unknown and only a rough guess can be made.\\nHis body is most likely buried at Ryugen-ji temple in Mitaka, Tokyo by Miyagawa Yugoro, who\\nwas said to have bribed someone into letting him claim the body. His head was probably\\nremoved to Hozo-ji temple in Kyoto. However the truth is not known for certain. Love Life - Aside from his wife, Kondo is known to have kept at least four mistresses. The most famous of\\nthese was Miyuki, who had previously been a courtesan in Kyoto. His relationship with her\\nseems to have begun sometime before Ikeda-ya and to have continued throughout the years the\\nShinsengumi were in the capitol. There&#8217;s a story which claims that Kondo was interested in a geisha who turned out to be a\\nsupporter of the Shishi. This woman apparently made an offer to be his if he would support their\\ncause, but he refused her and broke off the relationship. Early influences - As previously mentioned, Kondo&#8217;s father frequently told him stories which had a great influence\\non him later in life. One of the people that he told him about was Kato Kiyomasa, who had\\nplayed a prominent role in Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#8217;s invasion of Korea. After Toyotomi&#8217;s death, he\\nseems to have given his support to Tokugawa Ieyasu in the political disputes which led up to\\nSekigahara. Kato wrote down a great many of his insights and viewpoints, but very little of this\\nhas ever been translated into English. Kondo also heard two of the four great Chinese classics from his father. &#160;One of these was called\\n&#8220;Water Margin&#8221; or &#8220;Outlaws of the Marsh&#8221;. It seems to have been written by two men, Luo\\nGuanzhong and Shi Nai&#8217;an. The novel is the story of Sung Chiang and his 36 companions,\\nthough the book increases the number to 108. Sung Chiang was a real bandit and his men had\\ntheir base at Mount Liang around 1119. He is now a folk hero similar to Robin Hood. In an eerie\\nparallel to what would become of the Shinsengumi, he and all of his followers were either killed\\nby the government or chose to kill themselves. Brotherhood and defiance of authority are major\\nthemes in the book. Also interesting is that the bandits drew members from all walks of life. The other work was also by Luo Guanzhong and is called &#8220;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&#8221;.\\nApparently Kondo&#8217;s favorite character was from this story and was someone that his father\\nwould insist was still alive. Unfortunately the part which spoke about this person was not very\\nclear, but it could have possibly been referring to Guan Yu, who was a general in the army of Liu\\nBei and a very popular warrior. Legend claims he was nine feet tall with a red face and he owned\\na great steed named Red Hare. He was noted for his loyalty and righteousness, but was also\\naccused of being arrogant. In yet another eerie parallel, he was eventually captured by the enemy\\nand executed. Soon after his death, Guan Yu was deified and has been said to manifest himself\\nfrom time to time in order to help with certain tasks, which could explain why Kondo&#8217;s father\\nwould insist that the person was &#8220;still alive&#8221;.

\\r\\n Keisuke SANNAN (&#23665;&#21335;&#25964;&#21161;) [wiki-corpus] \\r\\n Keisuke SANNAN (1833 - March 20, 1865) was the chief (vice chief) of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was from the Sendai Domain of Mutsu Province (later Rikuzen Province). \\n Another way of reading his last name was &#8216;Yamanami,&#8217; but he signed his name as \\'&#19977;&#21335; (Sannan)&#8217; and \\'&#19977;&#30007; (Sannan),&#8217; so it was highly likely that his last name was pronounced \\'Sannan.&#8217; \\nHe called himself Saburo SANNAN in his old age. He excelled in both the literary and military arts and was an educated and warm person. \\n He became known to people as \\'Sannan-san.&#8217; Place of origin It was supposed that he left the Sendai Domain and went to Edo, but his last name of \\'&#23665;&#21335; (Sannan)&#8217; or \\'&#19977;&#21335; (Sannan)&#8217; does not exist in Sendai, so this fact is unknown. On the Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency) in Ono School Ittoryu (swordplay tradition), he later became a student of Shusaku Chiba of Hokushin Ittoryu. Shieikan He challenged other schools of Tennenrishinryu Swordplay Shieikan of Isami KONDO and defeated the opposing Kondo. At this time, he admired Kondo&#8217;s skill and personality and began to respect Kondo. After that, he carried out activities with Kondo as well as the students in Shieikan. Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, and Shinpachi NAGAKURA joined the Shieikan who would later be the top officials in Shinsengumi. In September 1861, he joined the nojiai (game) as the Red Army for Isami KONDO to announce the appointment of the fourth head of Tennenrishinryu. At New Year&#8217;s in 1862, he traveled to Onoji to instruct swordplay with Soji OKITA. Shinsengumi In March 1863, he joined roshi-gumi (an organization of masterless samurai) that was suggested by Hachiro KIYOKAWA that aimed to protect the shogun and Sonno Joi (slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) with Kondo and others, and went to the capital to become a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group). On May 13, he assassinated Yoshio TONOUCHI at Shijo-Ohashi Bridge with Kondo and Kamo SERIZAWA due to the hegemony dispute within the troops. In doing so, Mibu-Roshigumi, which gained the hegemony through an illicit union of Kondo&#8217;s and Serizawa&#8217;s group, placed Kondo and Serizawa as leaders and Sannan was appointed to be an assistant head (vice chief) with Toshizo HIJIKATA as a member of the Kondo group (Nishiki NIIMI from Serizawa group). The roshi-gumi was formed with aims for Sonno Joi, but it was under the custody of the Aizu clan, so he devoted himself to cracking down on repined masterless samurai in Kyoto. Around August 1863, Sannan and Hijikata had a fierce battle against a few repined masterless samurai who intruded into a kimono fabrics dealer called \\'Iwaki Shoya&#8217; and repelled them. Sannan also joined a coup on September 30 and killed roshi (masterless samurai) from the Choshu group, who were hiding in Kyoto, with Hijikata two days later. In October 1863, he joined the assassination of Kamo SERIZAWA who had been feuding for a while. The roshi-gumi was unified by the Kondo group (Sieikanha group), and Sannan was appointed to the chief for the organizational restructuring and positioned himself between the leader Kondo and the vice chief Toshizo HIJIKATA. However, he escaped after this incident. His name disappeared from the activity report of Shinsengumi until he committed Seppuku (suicide by disembowelment). He did not join the Ikedaya Incident in July 1864. \\n (Some say that he had been sick or protected the quarter during this time.) In December 1864, Kashitaro ITO was enrolled in the troops. Ito was Sannan&#8217;s fellow from the Hokushin-Ittoryu Kobudo School, an extreme proponent of Sonno Joi, and educated person. Ito was appointed to a higher rank position of general staff than Sannan and received special treatment. Escape In March 1865, Sannan left a note saying \\'I&#8217;m going to Edo&#8217; and escaped from Shinsengumi. Escape was a capital crime according to the rules set forth by the Shinsengumi. Kondo and Hijikata sent Okita to chase him, and Sannan was was captured in Omi Province, Otsu City and brought back to the quarter. \\n (*Some say it was not an escape.) There were several theories on the reasons behind Sannan&#8217;s escape. According to Kanefumi NISHIMURA, a valet of West Hongan-ji Temple, the issue of relocating the quarter is what drove Sannan into the corner. It was to move the quarter from Mibu to West Hongan-ji Temple. The reason was not only because Mibu was too cramped as the members grew in number, but also because West Hongan-ji Temple had strong loyalty to the Emperor and had close relationship with the Mori family of Choshu Domain. Moving to the temple, Hijikata thought to eradicate it all at once. Therefore, although the temple wanted to stop the transfer, he stubbornly refused to listen. Sannan, who was high-spirited in his loyalty to the Emperor, strongly opposed it, but Kondo and Hijikata paid absolutely no attention to him. Sannan, angry that he was being ignored, finally decided to break away from Shinsengumi. Some say that he had doubts on the way Shinsengumi was organized as what they actually did was oppress supporters when in fact it was meant to be organized for Sonno Joi. Some say that he made a secret promise with Ito, who would later withdrew from Shinsengumi. According to \\'Roshi (masterless samurai) Bunkyu Era Patriotism Articles&#8217; (written by Shinpachi NAGAKURA) found in 1998, he stayed in the quarter on the day of security patrol on July 29, 1864 due to the illness. Also, there is no statement about Sannan on the Kinmon Incident in the article, so some say that he suffered from illness. Seppuku He was advised to escape again by a top official, Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Ito, who had a long lasting relationship since they met in Shieikan, but Sannan prepared himself for death. This sad story was told that through Nagakura&#8217;s kind offices, Sannan&#8217;s old friend, Tenjin (upper rank prostitute) Akesato in Shimabara, who came to see Sannan and bade him a last farewell (but there was no description of Akesato in Nagakura&#8217;s journal \\'Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&#8217; and \\'Roshi Bunkyu Era Patriotism Articles,&#8217; so it was highly likely that this was created by Kan SHIMOZAWA). On March 20, 1865, he died from Seppuku. Sannan wanted Soji OKITA, whom he treated like his brother, to be Kaishaku (to assist someone in committing Seppuku by beheading him). He was 33 years old. \\n Kondo praised his Seppuku as \\'even Takuminokami ASANO couldn&#8217;t die this beautifully.&#8217; \\nKeisuke SANNAN was adored in Shinsengumi, and even Toshizo HIJIKATA, who was famous for the devil vice chief, cried when Keisuke SANNAN committed Seppuku. His grave is in Koen-ji Temple in Kyoto. Kashitaro ITO wrote four poems of waka in mourning Sannan&#8217;s death. Characters and others. Sannan was a kind-hearted person and was adored by women and children in Mibu area. There was a saying \\'kind persons are Sannan and Chuji MATSUBARA&#8217; which was popular in the Mibu until the early Meiji period. According to &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun (exceptional matters),&#8221; he had a good reputation among troops and in the Mibu area, unlike Kamo SERIZAWA. Shikanosuke KOJIMA, a sponsor of Shinsengumi, described Sannan as a \\'warrior but literate.&#8217; Even Kanefumi NISHIMURA, who was known for his sever criticism of Shinsengumi, called him \\'a person who understands method of matters in some degree&#8217; in &#8220;Mibu Roshi Shimatsuki&#8221; He was small in stature and had a fair-skinned lovable face. According to Tamesaburo YAGI who was a child of a house where the Shinsengumi was stationed, \\'he was not so tall, had fair-skinned lovable face, liked kids and talked to them wherever he met them&#8217; (Rojin Mibu Banashi (the Aged Mibu Story) by Tamesaburo YAGI). It seemed that when he left for the coup on September 30, while Kondo and Hijikata wrapped themselves up in Kacchu (armor and helmet), Sannan as the head did not receive Kacchu, so he was mad but Chuji MATSUBARA served as a buffer to ease his anger. Iwaki Masuya Incident \\nIn February 1864, while he was staying in Osaka to guard Iemochi TOKUGAWA, a few repined masterless samurai intruded into a kimono fabrics dealer called \\'Iwaki Shoya,&#8217; and both Toshizo HIJIKATA and Sannan rushed to the scene and repelled them after a fierce battle. For this achievement, Sannan received gold eight ryo (currency unit) from Katamori MATSUDAIRA. The sword (about 86.4cm) Sannan used in the incident was \\'a work by Okimitsu SEKISHIN, the resident in Harima Province,&#8217; had a nicked edge, and was broken at about 33.3cm. The impression (paper that traced a shape of sword like fish prints) of this sword was sent to Shikanosuke KOJIMA by Hijikata&#8217;s own hands, and even today, you can still see it in Kojima Shiryokan (Museum) (but the exhibit is a copy). According to &#8220;Ishin Shiseki Zusetsu (Restoration Historical Sites Book),&#8221; Sannan injured his left arm in this incident, and one theory was that his arm became crippled due to this injury, so he reconciled himself to be rusui (a person representing the master during his absence) during the Ikedaya Incident, and losing his footing as samurai and having a different opinion from Kondo&#8217;s and Hijikata&#8217;s served to facilitate his escape from the Shinsengumi. On the other hand, there was another theory that he only stayed as the head of a left-behind team to prepare for the attack on the quarter of roshi in Nagato Province during the Ikedaya Incident. In addition, on the Iwaki Masuya Incident, one theory said that the incident occurred around August 1863 and another theory said that only Sannan rushed to the scene. In 2004, in the NHK Historical drama \\'Shinsengumi!!&#8217; written by Koki Mitani, when Masato SAKAI, who was not very well known at that time, was hired to play the Keisuke SANNAN role, both Sakai and Sannan exploded in popularity. When he played the Sannan role, Sakai said that the smile he frequently showed was originally a smile to look down on the Tennenrishinryu group but gradually changed to become a caring smile, and this smile emphasized his benign image. NHK rebroadcasted (re-rebroadcasted to be exact) episode 33 \\'Friend&#8217;s death&#8217; where Sannan committed Seppuku, entitled \\'encore of 2004&#8217; after all episodes and omnibus were broadcast at the end of 2004. \\n It was extremely rare for only one episode out of 49 episodes to be rebroadcast, and this \\'Friend&#8217;s death&#8217; had the most response from the audience in the \\'Shinsengumi!&#8217; and it was said that some enthusiastic fans sent letters saying \\'please do not kill Sannan-san.&#8217; \\n(It seemed an impossible request on first glance, but on the other hand, Kenji NOGUCHI and a few others survived in \\'Shinsengumi!&#8217; while they had been in fact killed historically. There was a precedent of Tokisuke HOJO in &#8220;Tokumune HOJO (NHK Historical drama)&#8221;.) With the popularity of \\'Shinsengumi!,&#8217; there was an explosive increase in the number of tourists visiting Koen-ji Temple where Sannan buried, former Maekawa residence, and Mibu-dera Temple. On March 11, 2007 when the tourists calmed down, \\'Sannan-ki (memorial service for Sannan)&#8217; was held to mourn Keisuke SANNAN in the neighborhood of the former Maekawa residence, and a memorial event was held where offering of incense was made in the room where Keisuke SANNAN committed Seppuku. Incidentally, the festival to mourn an individual member of Shinsengumi was only fconducted for the five members of sami KONDO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, Hajime SAITO, and Keisuke SANNAN.

member of the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto, at the end of Edo period (there are two theories about the year of his birth, but no decisive historical materials against either of them have been found. Also, no historical materials confirming his birth date have ever been identified, and all that is known is that he was born in summer). He was the Assistant Vice Commander, captain of the First Corps and a master of kenjutsu sword fighting. His real family name was Fujiwara. His Imina (original name) was Harumasa and later, Kaneyoshi. His childhood name was Sojiro. He was the eldest son of Katsujiro OKITA, a clansman of Shirakawa Domain in Mutsu Province. He had two older sisters, one of whom, Mitsu OKITA, married Rintaro OKITA, making him the head of the family. Mitsu&#8217;s great grand son Tetsuya OKITA (1930-) is a scholar of public administration and an emeritus professor of the department of politics and economics at Meiji University. Biography He was born in Shirakawa Domain&#8217;s Edo residence (Minato Ward, Tokyo). His father Katsujiro died when he was four years old, and it is thought that his mother also died when he was young. At the age of about nine, he was apprenticed to Shuzo KONDO, who taught the Tennen Rishin-ryu style of martial arts at a dojo in Ichigaya, Edo, and it was here at the Shieikan dojo that he met fellow students Isami KONDO and Toshizo HIJIKATA, who would later be central in the formation of the Shinsengumi. Even though he was young, he served as the school manager of Tennenrishinryu. Okita&#8217;s genius with the sword is said to have been unequalled although his teaching style was rather rough. Later in his life, he softened his teaching style. He joined the Roshigumi (an organization of masterless samurai) upon its formation in 1863 and left for Kyoto, remaining there with Kondo and forming the Shinsengumi after the group split. Okita&#8217;s First Corps was constantly tasked with important missions and, although the Shinsengumi was filled with expert swordsmen, often had the most number of kills, and was involved in the assassinations of Kamo SERIZAWA and Hikojiro UCHIYAMA in October, 1863. Okita&#8217;s first recorded kill was on the evening of May 11, 1863. His opponent was Yoshio TONOUCHI, a member of the Roshigumi&#8217;s First Unit, who had come at Hachiro KIYOKAWA&#8217;s request. After the Ikedaya Incident of July 8, 1864, where he was involved in the killings of several members of the anti-Shogunate faction, he collapsed after coughing up blood from tuberculosis (according to many theories) but based on his subsequent involvement in the Shinsengumi, it is unreasonable to think that he developed lung tuberculosis on that day. Instead, there is a theory that he collapsed from heat stroke. In February 1865, he was sent after Shinsengumi Vice Commander Keisuke YAMANAMI, who had attempted to desert, and arrested him in Kusatsu City, Omi Province. Yamanami committed suicide assisted by Okita. Although Okita seemed to regard Yamanami as an older brother, he barely touched upon Yamanami&#8217;s death in a letter he sent home. He was active on the front lines until 1867, after which, unable to take part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he was escorted to Osaka. \\n (The most widely-accepted theory at present is that he was injured on his way to the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and developed tuberculosis on the boat he was being escorted to Osaka on.) \\nAfter defeat at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he sailed back to Edo with other members and although according to several theories he joined the Koyo Chinbutai (the successor to the Shinsengumi), he was forced to drop out halfway. After that, it is thought that Ryojun MATSUMOTO, a retainer of the Shogun, made arrangements for him to hide in a plant shop in Sendagaya, where he died in 1868. Since his date of birth is uncertain, there are several opinions about how old he was when he died, but he is believed to have been between twenty-five and twenty-seven. The purpose of their attack was to avenge the murder of their leader, Kashitaro ITO, by the Shinsengumi the previous month, but Okita had left for the Fushimi Magistrate&#8217;s office and therefore escaped the attempt. In the evening of the same day, Isami KONDO was shot and injured by Abe and the others on his way back from Nijo Castle. In the evening on the same day, Isami KONDO was shot and got injured by Abe and other members when he was back from Nijo-jo Castle. Two months after Isami KONDO was beheaded, Okita died, unaware of KONDO&#8217;s death. \\n The poem he composed on his deathbed reads &#8216;In the dark, flowers and water cannot be discerned unless they move&#8217; \\nHis grave is in Sensho-ji Temple in Motoazabu 3 cho-me, Minato Ward, Tokyo. His Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name) given by Sensho-ji Temple is Kenkoinjinyomeido-koji. The inscription on the Okita family grave stone states that he held menkyo-kaiden (a document handed down by a teacher to the student he believes is most capable of carrying on his art) for the Hokushin Itto-ryu school as well as Tennen Rishin-ryuu. There are three theories about his age when he died: twenty-four according to the Okita family grave stone; twenty-five according to documents held by the Okita family; and twenty-seven, if, as described in Shikanosuke KOJIMA&#8217;s &#8220;Ryoyushiden&#8221;, he was twenty-two when he left for Kyoto. There are also two opinions about the place where he died, one being Sendagaya and the other Imado (Taito Ward), but at present, it is widely accepted that after staying in Imado to recuperate for a while, he moved to Sendagaya and died there. Profile Shozan SAKUMA&#8217;s son, Keinosuke MIURA, had been made fun of by a fellow Shinsengumi officer. There is a story that a few days later, Hijikata and Okita were playing a game of Go when Miura attacked the officer who had made fun of him from behind and Okita, infuriated by the cowardly attack, grabbed Miura by the collar and, calling him a \\'bloody idiot&#8217;, pushed his face into the floor until his nose was raw. Belying his appearance as an able leader of the Ichiban-gumi, he was apparently a cheerful person who was always telling jokes and laughing. It seems he often played with children in his neighborhood. When novelist Ryotaro SHIBA was writing a book featuring the Shinsengumi, he interviewed an old woman who used to play with Okita when she was small. \\n (Taking into account that the interview took place around 1960 and that the Meiji Restoration was in 1868, the woman must have been quite old, but it means that people who actually met Soji OKITA were still alive.) Although Kanefumi NISHIMURA was known for severely criticizing Kondo, Hijikata and other members of the Shinsengumi, he left no comments on Okita or Keisuke YAMANAMI. This seems to show that Nishimura had no bad feelings towards Yamanami and Okita, and Okita is believed to have been easy-going towards people who were not hostile to the Shinsengumi. It is believed that just before his death, he tried several times to kill a black cat which often sneaked into the plant shop&#8217;s yard but always missed and, realizing his own weakness, he said as follows. \\n Alas, I cannot kill it!&#8217; \\nSee! (he said to the old woman who was attending him), I cannot kill it&#8217; (this story is said to have been created by Kan SHIMOZAWA.) There is also a story that he was worried about Kondo and, up until his death, he repeatedly asked, \\'I am wondering how the master (Kondo) has been. Didn&#8217;t we receive a letter from him?&#8217; \\nBecause people close to him were prohibited from telling him about Kondo&#8217;s death, he passed away without learning of it. There is another anecdote that when Kondo was still alive and visiting Okita in bed before setting out with the Koyo Chinbutai, the usually cheerful Okita on this occasion sobbed loudly. It is generally thought that Kondo, Hijikata and Okita were very close to each other, with Hijikata and Okita in particular being like brothers, but this is largely the result of novels by Ryotaro SHIBA and Kan SHIMOZAWA. There are no materials to show that Hijikata and Okita were extremely close, although there is a record of Okita writing a letter on behalf of Hijikata. Juro ABE, who was opposed to the Shinsengumi, said, \\'Kondo&#8217;s high-caliber disciples, Soji OKITA and Kuwajiro OISHI, are very cruelhearted men and, from the beginning, appear not to have realized even the existence of the state or the Imperial Court&#8217; (&#8220;Shidankaisokkiroku&#8221;) and attacked them and Izo OKADA for having no ideological background and for being used as &#8220;tools to kill people&#8221;. In addition, according to Okita&#8217;s students, he was \\'extremely harsh and quick-tempered&#8217; and they feared him more than the master, Kondo. The image of Okita gained from anecdotes such as his telling his trainees, \\'Don&#8217;t kill people with your sword! Kill them with your body!&#8217; and other records differs greatly from the gentle and calm image that is widely known in public. Sword Technique Okita&#8217;s most famous sword technique is the \\'Sandantsuki&#8217; (Three Stage Thrust). Starting from the Tennenrishin-ryu stance of \\'hiraseigan&#8217;, he delivered three thrusts in the time he was heard to take one step forward. It is often presented in novels as his opponent thinking he has been stabbed once when actually, in the blink of an eye, he has been stabbed three times. However, the exact details are unknown. According to Sen SATO in &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun&#8221;, Okita&#8217;s sword style was identical to his master, Kondo&#8217;s and even his thin, high-pitched yells were very alike. \\n However, it is thought that he had a habit of leaning his body forward and holding his sword with the point slightly lowered, a slightly different posture to Kondo, who pushed his abdomen a little forward in the hiraseigan stance.) Shinpachi NAGAKURA&#8217;s statement that Okita&#8217;s technique \\'left Toshizo HIJIKATA, Genzaburo INOUE, Heisuke TODO, Keisuke YAMANAMI and the others looking like children playing with bamboo swords. Everyone said that if Okita seriously fought his master, Kondo would lose,&#8217; (&#8220;Nagakura Shinpachi Idan,&#8221;) is well-known but there are also comments to the same effect from outside the Shinsengumi&#8217;s inner circle. Shikanosuke KOJIMA mentioned before the formation of Shinsengumi (in July 1862) that Okita \\'is someone who will definitely reach the level of a master of the sword later in his life&#8217; (&#8220;Kojima Nikki&#8221;) and Kanefumi NISHIMURA, although critical of the Shinsengumi, called him \\'Kondo&#8217;s most cherished follower and the best swordsman in his unit&#8217; and \\'a genius with the sword&#8217; (&#8220;Mibu Roshi Shimatsuki&#8221;). Juro ABE, who fought against the Shinsengumi, stated in &#8220;Shidankaisokkiroku&#8221; that \\'As one of Kondo&#8217;s students, Soji OKITA is an excellent swordsman&#8217;, &#8217; Soji OKITA and Kamajiro OISHI are young but have shown great skill with the sword on many occasions&#8217; and \\'Kamajiro OISHI, Soji OKITA and Genzaburo INOUE have killed people without reason&#8217;, all of which shows it would have been extremely dangerous to make enemies of them. \\n The only negative opinion was from Yaichiro CHIBA, a member of the Shinchogumi (the Shinsengumi&#8217;s Edo counterpart) and a colleague of Okita&#8217;s brother-in-law, who said, \\'from our viewpoint, their skills are suitable for mokuroku (a low level)&#8217; \\nOf course, Nagakura&#8217;s statement that Yamanami, who had attained \\'menkyo-kaiden&#8217; in the Hokushin Itto-ryu, and Todo, who was almost at the mokuroku level, were like children seems extreme, but may imply how superb and outstanding Okita&#8217;s skill with the sword was. Okita&#8217;s Sword In novels, the sword owned by Soji OKITA is depicted as being a \\'Kikuichimonji Norimune&#8217; (swords made at the beginning of the thirteenth century). The story gained popularity following its appearance in the novel &#8220;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#8221; by Ryotaro SHIBA, who based it on descriptions in biograraphies such as that by Kan SHIMOZAWA, where the sword is described as being \\'a thin Kikuichimonji one&#8217;. However, despite being a period when Japanese swords were everyday items, Norimune swords were extremely valuable old swords, and it is believed that, from an economical point of view and from the necessity of having to use it often in actual battles, Okita would hardly have been likely to own one, although the matter has hardly been discussed among researchers. Okita is known to have owned swords made by Kiyomitsu KASHU and Yasusada YAMATO NO KAMI. In addition to the Norimune swords, there were several other thin types of swords with a &#8220;Kikuniichi&#8221; crest, and it is possible that Okita&#8217;s sword may have been one of these. In any event, like the other members of the Shinsengumi, he is likely to have exchanged his swords often during his stay in Kyoto. A Handsome Youth Since his appearance in Ryotaro SHIBA&#8217;s novels, he has often been depicted in fiction, including novels and TV series, as a handsome young man. Okita&#8217;s likeness can be seen in a portrait that was painted in 1929 based on a claim by his older sister, Mitsu, that her grandson, Kaname, \\'somehow resembles Soji&#8217;. \\n There are no descriptions of him being \\'a handsome youth&#8217; from members of the Yagi family or from people connected to the Shinsengumi; instead, he is described as having a \\'face like a flatfish, though tanned and not unnattractive when laughing&#8217;, \\'square shoulders&#8217;, \\'a rounded back&#8217; and being \\'very tall.&#8217; \\n(In &#8220;Ryoma ni omakase!&#8221; (Leave things to Ryoma) and &#8220;Getsumeiseiki - Sayonara Shinsengumi&#8221;, the depiction of Okita was closer to the above.) \\nThe image that emerges from these descriptions casts doubt on the \\'handsome youth&#8217; theory. Ryotaro SHIBA, wanting to enhance the drama (a young man killed by tuberculosis just as his skill with the sword is becoming legendary) in Okita&#8217;s life and so made him a handsome young man in his novel &#8220;Moeyo Ken&#8221;, which was followed by many other works, including the movie &#8220;Bakumatsu Junjoden&#8221; in which Okita was depicted as beatiful girl. The image of Okita as a handsome young man seems to come from the mistaken notion that the dramatized image of him as &#8220;a powerful swordsman and cheerful but, at the same time, sickly and pale&#8221; is the generally accepted image. The fact that Okita is always played on the screen by young, good-looking actors is also thought to have had a significant influence on his image. However, the origin of the \\'Soji&#8217;s face is like a flatfish&#8217; belief seemed to be a light jokey answer made by a great grand son of Hikogoro SATO when Haruo TANI said a lighthearted joke to him in a TV program, and according to Tani, \\'Soji&#8217;s face is like a flatfish&#8217; does not mean his face is flat but the two eyes of other family members including his sisters in photos are closely-spaced. However, Tetsuya OKITA completely rejected this idea. According to him, Soji was described within the Okita family as \\'a light-skinned and small man&#8217;. For likenesses and pictures, follow the external links. Soji OKITA&#8217;s Romance Following his appearance in Ryotaro SHIBA&#8217;s books, Okita is generally often depicted in fiction as a pure and innocent young man. Most works describe him as having a platonic relationship with the daughter of a local doctor, and in actual fact, he seems to have steered clear of women from Karyukai (the geisha district), unlike Kondo and Hijikata. However, according to the April 22, 1863 entry of his Matsugoro INOUE&#8217;s diary, Hijikata, Matsugoro, Genzaburo INOUE and Okita paid for prostitutes at the Yoshidaya in the Kuken-cho area of the Shinmachi courtesan&#8217;s district, so it cannot be said that he never played around with women, although when talk turned to a woman he was fond of, he became very serious. The register of deaths at Koen-ji Temple lists as \\'Okita&#8217;s relative&#8217; a woman who is thought to have been Okita&#8217;s lover. According to the researchers, the woman&#8217;s name was Tsune ISHII and she had a daughter. It is believed, but unproven, that the woman gave birth to Okita&#8217;s daughter, who was named Kyo. There was another Okita in the Shinsengumi, a man called Jonoshin OKITA, who had been recruited by Hijikata in Edo in 1865, and there is a theory that the \\'Okita&#8217; in the register of deaths may be Jonoshin. There is an old anecdote that a woman (who was apparently a strong-willed and spirited person) working in the Shieikan dojo asked Okita to marry her but he turned down her proposal, saying \\'I am still an apprentice&#8217; (the woman attempted suicide, possibly because of his rejection, and later married another man after being introduced by Kondo). It is believed that this woman was Ko IWATA, who is thought to have been Shuhei KONDO&#8217;s fianc&#233;e. He is also thought to have been close to a girl called Kin, the daughter of the Satomo Inn on Aburakoji Street. Onset of Tuberculosis Works of fiction always have Soji OKITA coughing up blood and collapsing during the fighting in the Ikedaya Incident. However, as mentioned above, this anecdote is not supported by researchers. Reasons include the fact that the description of Okita&#8217;s coughing up blood only appears in Kan SHIMOZAWA&#8217;s &#8220;Shinsen-gumi Shimatsuki&#8221;; Okita participated in the hunt for the remnants of the Choshu forces (see &#8220;Akebonotei Jiken&#8221;, the Akebonotei Incident); and there is a record (&#8220;Koshi sensoki&#8221; Kanefumi NISHIMURA) of him joining Isami KONDO, Saizo HIJIKATA, Kanryusai TAKEDA and Shinpachi NAGAKURA in the Kinmon Incident the following month, and if his tuberculosis was advanced enough to cause him to cough up blood, they would not have dared to let him go. There is another anecdote that after the Shinsengumi&#8217;s group medical examination in around 1866, the shogunate&#8217;s doctor, Ryojun MATSUMOTO, left a note that \\'one of the members had pulmonary tuberculosis&#8217;, and it is thought that the man may have been Soji OKITA. In 1867, the disease seems to have progressed enough that people around him noticed it; Shikanosuke KOJIMA in &#8220;Ryoyu jitsuroku&#8221; said he contracted it in March; according to Kanefumi NISHIMURA&#8217;s &#8220;Mibu Roshi Shimatsuki&#8221;, he was seriously ill around September when the quarters were moved to Fudodo Village; and in a letter to Kondo dated October 13, Kojima wrote that he was worried about Okita&#8217;s worsening condition. Given the above, when Okita&#8217;s health condition worsened so critical that he could not bear fighting was from autumn to winter in 1867. It is also thought that his intense exercise might have been an added burden on his lungs and aggravated his illness. The scenes of Okita spitting blood and falling unconscious at the Ikedaya in works such as &#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221; seem to have originated in Shinpachi NAGAKURA&#8217;s &#8220;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&#8221;, which, while not mentioning spitting blood, does describe Okita falling unconscious. He may have suffered a light and temporary heat stroke following the intense battle, which took place on a humid and extremely hot day in early summer, and it is thought that his condition did not raise any questions about his lungs for those close to him, including Kondo and Nagakura.

city. His imina (posthumous name) is Yoshitoyo. His pseudonym is Hogyoku. He was a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate at the end of Edo Period. Was feared by all as the vice commander of Shinsen-gumi. \\n Family crest is Hidari Mitsudomoe Tama/Shiei-kan He was born in Ishida village, Tama district, Musashi province (is now Ishida, Hino city, Tokyo). (He has been said to be the youngest among 6 brothers and sisters, but materials discovered in recent years revealed that he was actually the youngest among 10 brothers and sisters.) The HIJIKATA family was a wealthy farmer called &#8220;Odaijin&#8221; who had farmed on large stretches of land in the Tama region for generations. He lost his father before he was born and his mother at the age of 6, and he was brought up by his second oldest brother, Kiroku and Kiroku&#8217;s wife. Until now, it has been said that he went to work at &#8220;Matsuzakaya Ito Gofuku store&#8221; (present-day Matsuzakaya Ueno store) in Ueno, Edo at the age of 11, but soon quarreled with the head clerk and returned to Hino; according to a newly published copy of Ninbetsu-cho of Ishida village it became clear that he was living in Ishida village when he was 11 years old, and therefore had not yet gone to work at the store. Although there are some missing parts based on this Ninbetsu-cho it is assumed that Toshizo went to work for a period of 10 years from the age of 14 to 24 (counted in the old Japanese way). There is a legend that he was sent to work at a cotton wholesale store (called Kamedana, in comparison with the Ueno store which was called Tsurudana) in Edo Tenma-cho, a branch of Matsuzakaya Ueno store, but because he had problems with a woman there (there is also a rumor that he was forced into a sexual relationship by the head clerk) he returned to Hino; however, due to the existence of the Ninbetsu-cho described above, the reliability of such stories are now in doubt. Subsequently, it is said that he traveled and sold &#8220;Ishida Sanyaku medicine&#8221; whose secret recipe has been passed on in his family; at the same time he also trained himself by fighting in many swordsmanship matches with other schools in dojos located around the country. It is around this time that he is assumed to have met Isami KONDO (who later became the commander of Shinsen-gumi), the 4th Head of Tennen Rishin-ryu, who was on a training trip to Sato Dojo in Hino; on March 29 1859, Toshizo formally became a disciple of Tennen Rishin-ryu. Toshizo&#8217;s older sister, Nobu SATO, was married to Hikogoro SATO, who was also their cousin and Nanushi (headman of the city) of Hino-jyuku, Hino city; it is said that Toshizo often visited the residence of Hikogoro. Hikogoro once was nearly killed during a major fire; after this incident, and on the advice of Matsugoro INOUE, an older brother of Genzaburo INOUE, Hikogoro became a disciple of Tennen Rishin-ryu and started a Dojo in a corner of his house. Because of this background Hikogoro took a pledge of brotherhood with KONDO and supported Tennen Rishin-ryu. It is said that Toshizo also trained himself in swordsmanship at this Dojo. In February of the 3rd year of Bunkyu, Toshizo, together with his comrades of Kondo Dojo (Shiei-kan), applied for the Roshigumi to guard Iemochi TOKUGAWA, Seii Taishogun of the Shogunate, and departed for Kyoto. Vice Commander of Shinsenh-gumi After the political change on August 18 1863, the active role of Miburoshi-gumi was acknowledged, and Shinsen-gumi was set up. Subsequently, Nishiki NIMI committed hara-kiri, and Toshizo directly assassinated Kamo SERIZAWA and some others. Isami KONDO, who acquired power, became the commander. Toshizo assumed the position as vice commander, and as Isami KONDO&#8217;s right hand man he engaged himself in maintaining peace and order in Kyoto. Systematic structure by each duty such as Jyokin, Kansatsu, etc., of Shinsen-gumi was formed, and while the Head of the organization was the commander, the actual directing orders were given by Toshizo, the vice commander. Upon Ikedaya Incident on June 5 1864, Toshizo lead half of the troop to search around Tantora (Shikokuya), visited frequently by members of the Choshyu clan and the Tosa clan, but nobody was there. He promptly rushed to Ikedaya to assist and immediately had his men draw their swords from the sheaths, but instead of entering the building they guarded the area around Ikedaya in order to prevent the soldiers of the Aizu and the Kuwana clans (who would arrive later) from entering Ikedaya, thereby ensuring that only Shinsen-gumi would receive full credit for the achievement. Such actions were taken with Shinsen-gumi&#8217;s position, still weak at the time, in consideration. This was a tactful and calculating wit typical of Toshizo. Consequently, rewards received for Ikedaya Incident were unprecedented, and their names became widely known throughout the country. The Shogunate unofficially notified to assign KONDO as Yoriki Joseki (Head of Additional Soldiers) and Shinsen-gumi members as Yoriki (Additional Soldiers), but Toshizo persuaded KONDO not to settle for a Yoriki, aim for a Daimyo instead and wait for the next opportunity; KONDO heeded his advice. Within Shinsen-gumi, he always made members follow the rules of Shinsen-gumi and ordered a hara-kiri to the members who broke the rules; it is said that the members feared him. Therefore, it is said that the top reason for death of a Shinsen-gumi was due to hara-kiri. Also, members who escaped from Shinsen-gumi were made to conduct hara-kiri or were killed with a sword and [their bodies] exhibited as warning to others. Subsequently, the other vice commander, Keisuke YAMANAMI assumed the position of Soucho, and HIJIKATA became the only vice commander. Regarding the incident where YAMANAMI was ordered to conduct a hara-kiri after he lost his position within Shinsen-gumi and escaped [and captured], it is said that there was a dispute between YAMANAMI and HIJIKATA, but actually they seemed to have been good friends. After that, he also had Kisaburo KAWAI, Sanjyuro TANI, Kanryusai TAKEDA and others conduct hara-kiri, or had them killed by a sword so as to maintain the order within Shinsen-gumi. He sent Hajime SAITO to Goryoeji formed by Kashitaro ITO and took measures to successfully prevent ITO&#8217;s plan to assassinate KONDO; he assassinated ITO and Heisuke TODO and completely destroyed Goryoeji (however, there are different stories regarding Goryoeji and ITO). Boshin War He was promoted to a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate in June, 1867. However, on October 14th of the same year, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA resigned from the position of Seii Taishogun, and upon Restoration of the Imperial Rule (Japan) on December 9th, the Shogunate essentially collapsed. On January, 13th, 4th year of Keio, Boshin War started with the Battle of Toba Fushimi; in place of Isami KONDO, who was wounded in Sumizome Incident, Toshizo lead Shinsen-gumi and fought as a deputy of commander but was defeated against the army of the new government in gun fighting. From around the 1st year of Keio, prior to being defeated in Battle of Toba Fushimi, Toshizo realized that from now on war could not be fought with swords and he started to prepare western-style armaments. After the Shogunate army lost Battle of Toba Fushimi and retreated from Osaka to Edo, KONDO temporarily named himself Yamato OKUBO and Toshizo named himself Hayato NAITO, and they set off to Kai province. However, on March 6th they were defeated in Battle of Kosyu Katsunuma. Toshizo rushed to request for reinforcements but was not successful. Subsequently, they were trying to recover power in Nagareyama but on April 3rd, they were suddenly surrounded by the army of the new government; the commander, KONDO, surrendered himself to the army of the new government. On this occasion, it is said that Toshizo stopped KONDO from committing hara-kiri, and persuaded KONDO to present himself to the army of the new government. Toshizo went to Edo and directly negotiated with Kaishu KATSU and others and pleaded them to spare KONDO&#8217;s life, but he was not successful; KONDO was executed (beheaded) on April 25 1868, at a place close to Itabashi (currently, his tomb is located in front of JR Itabashi Station). After KONDO surrendered himself to the army of the new government, Toshizo, besides pleading for KONDO&#8217;s life, entrusted Shinsen-gumi in the care of Hajime SAITO (Jiro YAMAGUCHI) and made them go to Aizu; Toshizo took only a few members including Kai SHIMADA and joined the army led by Keisuke OTORI and others, which was formed by men who escaped from the army of the former Shogunate. On April 11th, when evacuation of Edo Castle without bloodshed succeded, Toshizo escaped from Edo and acted as a staff officer of the vanguard army led by Noborinosuke AKIZUKI. They passed through the Shimodate clan and the Shimotsuma clan, and won the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle and conquered Utsunomiya Castle. However, they lost Battle of Mibu and fled; they fought again with the army of the new government in Utsunomiya during which Toshizo injured his leg; he was escorted to Aizu before the main army arrived in Aizu. In Aizu, he spent 3 months in recuperation, and it is said that during this time he built Isami KONDO&#8217;s tomb in Tennei-ji Temple. After he fully recovered and returned to the battle line he endeavored to protect Aizu, but Battle of Aizu intensified after they lost the Battle of Bonari-toge in August. Toshizo visited the Shonai clan to request for reinforcements, but Shonai had already pledged allegiance to the new government and did not allow him to even enter the castle. Toshizo decided to depart for Sendai from Aizu. It is said that Jiro YAMAGUCHI (Hajime SAITO) and others appealed to Keisuke OTORI, who left the battle line in a way similar to Toshizo, that he should be as loyal as possible to the Aizu clan; however, this story comes from an old document which was recorded at a later date in Hakodate. HIJIKATA had not returned to Shinsen-gumi when they were in the domains of the Aizu clan. Shinsen-gumi broke up into the group of YAMAGUCHI and others who remained in the castle town and the group of members who left at Tennei-ji temple. Toshizo arrived in Sendai and joined the navy of the former Shogunate led by Takeaki ENOMOTO. Together with ENOMOTO Toshizo participated in military meetings of Ouetsu Reppan Domei (Northern Alliance) and was recommended to become General of Domei Army; however, Ouetsu Reppan Domei soon collapsed, and after the clans forming the Domei Army surrended one after another to the army of the new government, Toshizo decided to fight until the end, so long as there is a place where he can fight. The Shinsen-gumi members who remained alive boarded Oemaru along with the men from the Kuwana clan, and they left Orinohama, Sendai (currently, Orinohama, Ishinomaki city, Miyagi prefecture) with Takeaki ENOMOTO and others on October 12th and went to Ezo. Hakodate War (Died in the War) The image of Toshizo HIJIKATA After landing on Washinoki of Ezo on October 20th, Toshizo became General of Kando Army and headed for Goryokaku. Shinsen-gumi traveled by the main road under the leadership of General Keisuke OTORI, but a few members of Shinsen-gumi including Kai SHIMADA, are said to have followed Toshizo. After occupying Goryokaku in Hakodate Toshizo advanced his army including Gakuheitai army and others.; he conquered Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) and chased the retreating army of the enemy to Esashi. On this occasion, Takeaki ENOMOTO went to the offing of Esashi in order to support HIJIKATA&#8217;s family from the sea, but his ship was stranded because of a storm. ENOMOTO, who landed in Esashi, and Toshizo watched Kaiyomaru sink, and they are said to have punched a pine tree which stood nearby and lamented together; the &#8220;Nageki no Matsu&#8221; (pine tree of lament) still remains today. Toshizo, who managed to occupy Esashi, temporarily returned to Matsumae Castle; he returned to Goryokaku on December 15th for the Celebration of Conquest of Ezo held by ENOMOTO, to which ENOMOTO invited the consuls of various countries. Subsequently, an election to determine leaders was held, and Ezo Republic (headquarters in Goryokaku) was established; Toshizo, as one of the leaders, became vice-minister of the Army and concurrently served as Torishimari of Hakodate city and chief of the Court of the Army and the Navy. It is said that Toshizo remained calm in Hakodate. When ENOMOTO and others were drinking to celebrate the establishment of the Hakodate government Toshizo alone remained silent and said &#8220;this is not the time for jubilation.&#8221; He was engaged in consolidating Hakodate/Goryokaku from January to February, and when the news of an attack by the army of the new government reached his ears in March Toshizo participated in Naval Battle of Miyakowan which targeted to seize Azuma-kan of the army of the new government; however, this operation failed, and many died or were wounded, but Toshizo managed to return safely. On April 9, 1869, the army of the new government started to land in Otobe, Ezo. Toshizo made every effort to defend against the attacks of the army of the new government in Battle of Futamataguchi. During the battle, the army of the new government rang bells to trick the enemy into thinking that they were surrounded; HIJIKATA&#8217;s army thought that they were surrounded and was upset. Toshizo calmly judged the circumstances and calmed his men down by telling them that &#8220;if our enemy really wished to surround us they would hide all noises so that we will not notice them.&#8221; Also, in between the fighting, Toshizo himself went around and offered his men a drink of sake. He told them &#8220;only one drink for each of you, as I do not want you to get drunk and break the rules of the army&#8221;; his men laughed and agreed. Futamataguchi, which HIJIKATA army defended desparately, continued to win a series of battles. However, the other entrance at Matsumaeguchi fell under the attacks of the enemy, and as there was a risk of losing a route for a retreat they had no choice but to return to Goryokaku. The soldiers lead by OHNO, who were advancing in the direction of Daiba under the order of Toshizo, were temporarily regaining their power, but they suddenly lost control and suffered a total defeat despite OHNO&#8217;s desperate instructions. OHNO had no choice but to return, and he was informed by Saisuke YASUTOMI, who was also an Assistant General of the Army, that Toshizo had died in the battle. Toshizo&#8217;s body was claimed by Chonosuke KOSHIBA and others, and is said to have been buried either in Goryokaku with the bodies of others who died in the war or in another place. The other place [of burial] has not been specified. He died at the age of 35. His farewell poem was &#8220;Even if my body decays around the islands of Ezo, my soul will protect my lord who lives in the East &#8221;. The poem is also known as &#8220;Should my body decay in the islands of Ezo, my soul will protect my lord who lives in the East.&#8221; The locations of his tombs are: \\nSekidenji temple of Ishida, Hino city, Tokyo, \\nShomyo-ji temple of Funami-cho, Hakodate-city, Hokkaido (memorial). Tennei-ji temple of Higashiyamamachi, Aizu-Wakamatsu city, Fukushima prefecture (wooden memorial). \\n Jyutokuji temple of Takinogawa, Kita-ku, Tokyo \\nEntsuji temple of Minami Senju, Arakawa-ku, Tokyo, and others. Toshizo&#8217;s Kosyo (servant; personal assisitant), Tetsunosuke ICHIMURA Just before his death, Toshizo handed locks of his hair to be kept as a memonto and his photograph to Tetsunosuke CHIMURA, who served him as Kosyo, and ordered Tetsunosuke to &#8220;deliver them to my family in Hino.&#8221; \\n ICHIMURA refused this request, saying &#8220;I came here to die in battle, \\nplease give your order to someone else&#8221;. On hearing this, Toshizo said with a glare &#8220;if you refuse, I will kill you here now&#8221;. ICHIMURA was overwhelmed by such strong spirit of Toshizo and agreed to carry out his order. When he departed for Hino, ICHIMURA realized that someone was standing by a window. ICHIMURA left the words that &#8220;I could not tell who it was, but probably it was Mr. HIJIKATA&#8221;. Subsequently, ICHIMURA managed to safely deliver Toshizo&#8217;s articles to Hikogoro SATO at Hino-jyuku. His favorite swords were the sword, Izumi no Kami Kenesada \\nand the small sword, Horikawa Kunihiro. Anecdotes It is said that when he was a child, he often remained naked after taking a bath, and practiced Sumo with a pillar in his house. The pillar still exists today. =&gt; A story that has been handed down in the HIJIKATA family. Taken from &#8220;Taizo HIJIKATA told by his descendants&#8221; written by Meguji HIJIKATA. The pillar is kept at Hijikata Toshizo Museum. When his nephew (Hikogoro SATO&#8217;s 3rd son, Tamekichi) fell down in the garden and cut his forehead, it is said that Taizo immediately rushed towards Tamekichi, laughed and caressed the boy saying, &#8220;the boy is wounded when he was confronting the world, so joyful, so joyful.&#8221; =&gt; A story that has been handed down in the SATO family. Taken from &#8220;Kikigaki Shinsengumi&#8221; written by Akira SATO. Only records of Chugokui Mokuroku awarded to Toshizo remain in Tennen-Rishin-ryu dojo today. It seems that he could not get rid of the ways of various schools which he learnt while he was traveling as a peddler. Nevertheless, it is said that he was awfully strong in actual fighting (it is said that he fought with no restraints, for example, by throwing the sand on the ground at his opponent and slashing or strangling him while heflinched from Toshizo&#8217;s initial attack). As can be seen from his photo of a later year dressed in western clothing, it is said that Toshizo was a rationalist and had the flexibility to accept useful things; for example, he owned a western pocket watch, etc. He once said to colleagues of Shinsen-gumi who were close to him, &#8220;probably I am reborn from Nobunaga ODA&#8221;. It is said that he created strict rules for Shinsen-gumi, such as Jinchu Hatto and Kyokuchu Hatto, and mercilessly killed betrayers or those who did not follow the rules; he was referred to as the pitiless vice commander, and in general, he was considered to be a heartless person. However, according to Nobori NAKAJIMA who followed Toshizo up to Hakodate War, at the time of Hakodate War &#8220;he was mild and was admired by his men as if he was their mother.&#8221; It is said that around this time, he started to often take young members of Shinsen-gumi out to meals and drink, and he listened to and advise them on their problems. However, there is a view that this was not because he has become older, but this was a calculated action based on his realization that he has found a place to die, as well as for motivating his men who could die tomorrow in a battle. Because he was a tall (for that time), handsome man with a fair complexion and firm features he was very popular among ladies; when he was acting as the vice commander of Shinsen-gumi in Kyoto he sent to his colleagues in Hino a bundle of love letters he had received from many women so as to boast his popularity. Soon after he went to Kyoto, a large package from him arrived in attention to Shikanosuke KOJIMA (one story says that the package was addressed to the disciples of KONDO Dojo). \\n Shikanosuke opened the package thinking that Toshizo might have sent presents from Kyoto, but the package was filled with love letters from geishas and apprentice geishas who were in love with Toshizo. The following tanka poem is said to have accompanied the letter [from Toshizo]: Ladies make me forget to do my best for my country. =&gt; a story told by Shikanosuke KOJIMA. Taken from &#8220;Shinsen-gumi Yowa&#8221; written by Masataka KOJIMA. Toshizo, who had his leg wounded in Battle of Utsunomiya, was in sickbed at an inn in the castle town of Aizu Wakamatsu from around April to July of 1868 (there are different views regarding the period). One day, Mitsuzo MOCHIZUKI, a vassal of the Shogunate and a public servant who was staying at the same inn as Toshizo, visited him, but Toshizo remained in his bed and said to him, &#8220;fight with us.&#8221; MOCHIZUKI who got annoyed by this arrogant attitude refused by saying, &#8220;I am a public servant so I cannot fight.&#8221; \\n Then Toshizo spoke unreservedly &#8220;then what did you come so far away for, you coward!&#8221; \\nMOCHIZUKI retorted that &#8220;you were fortunate enough to seize Utsunomiya Castle, but wasn&#8217;t the castle soon retaken? \\nIt is probably difficult to seize the castle again now. How regrettable. I have no choice but to call you a coward, also&#8221;. Toshizo, upon hearing Mochizuki, shouted &#8220;Shut up, you are making my illness worse. \\n I do not want to hear any more from you, \\nleave&#8221; so MOCHIZUKI left his room. On this occasion, Toshizo was so angry that he threw his pillow at MOCHIZUKI. =&gt;Taken from &#8220;Yumeno Uwagoto&#8221; written by Mitsuzo MOCHIZUKI and &#8220;Kokuhaku no Kokuhatsu&#8221; written by Shison MOCHIZUKI. When Toshizo was in Edo, he normally stayed in Kamaya, an inn patronized by the Shogunate. It was one of the busy Chaya restaurants among Shinagawa-syuku, and the following record remains today: &#8220;On October 21st, the third year of Keio, family and disciples of the Shinsen-gumi member, Toshizo HIJIKATA, totaling 31 people rested, Hanuemon KAMAYA, fee was 9 kan and 300 mon.&#8221; A memorial of Shinsen-gumi now stands at the site of Kamaya (currently, Aomono-yokocho Station, Shinagawa-ku). Hobbies \\nSurprisingly, he was a person of taste, and he enjoyed making tanka poems and haiku, etc. He has written many poems and left poetry books such as &#8220;Hogyoku Hokku-shu,&#8221; etc. I can see the spring moon on my way to a public duty. The crescent moon is shining at the bottom of a puddle formed by the spring rain. My heart is pure, as I face my reflection on the water. I listen to the sounds made by a plover, together with the sounds of water. I see the spring moon over the temple gate. If an apricot flower blooms, even if only one, it is still an apricot flower. The seven plants of spring, I manage to memorize up to five. I cannot help resting my hand as I dust the shelves, when I hear a warbler sing. It is cold sleeping in a shabby house, the spring moon shines above. The road of love, If you know it you are lost, if you know it not, you will not get lost. North of the waters, and south of the mountains, is the spring moon. The days and months of the year which pass by, I cannot do anything about it. The clouds of May fly towards my hometown. The road of love, If you know it you are lost, if you know it not, you will not get lost. It is indeed the month of March, some snow vanish as they fall. On the morning snow, there are no horizontal footsteps. Actors and voice artists who played Toshizo HIJIKATA Because of the excellent performance given in &#8220;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#8221; and &#8220;Moeyo Ken&#8221;, Asahi KURIZUKA is known as a legendary figure and a great actor playing the part of Toshizo HIJIKATA. It is well known that when Ryotaro SHIBA saw Asahi KURIZUKA wearing the uniform of Shinsen-gumi, SHIBA highly praised KURIZUKA.

\\r\\n \\r\\n Yamanami Keisuke [shinsengumi-no-makoto] \\r\\n Vice-commander of the Shinsengumi Born - 1833 or 1835 in Michinoka, Sendai. Died - February 23, 1865 in Mibu, Kyoto at either age 33 or 31 [32 or 30]. Names - Imina - Tomonobu One of the reasons why there is so little information about Yamanami is that some think this may\\nhave been an assumed name. Also, there is a question of how he pronounced his name.\\nAccording to the way the kanji was read during the Edo period, he may have actually called\\nhimself &#8220;Sannan&#8221;. Physical Description - Yamanami was &#8220;slightly tall&#8221; and had a pale complexion. His face was supposed to be somewhat\\nround. Personality Quirks and Traits - He is described as a gentle, amiable man and was very intelligent. He enjoyed reading Chinese\\npoetry. Yamanami was loved by the people of the Mibu neighborhood. Yet despite all of this he\\ncould be very severe when he needed to be. Aside from Kondo, it is said that he got along well with Okita, Todo, and Ito. His exact\\nrelationship with Hijikata is the subject of debate. Family History - Almost nothing is known of Yamanami&#8217;s past. He may have been the second son of a fencing\\ninstructor. Another theory is that his father was a lower samurai of the Sendai clan. There was\\nalso an opinion that he was the third son of the family. Martial Skills - Ryu - Houkushin Itto Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Chiba Shusaku, Genbukan dojo Yamanami is thought to have went to Edo to study in his early teens. He attended one of the three\\nmost prestigious fencing schools of era, studying under one of the greatest swordmasters of all\\ntime. According to legend that was not enough to help him defeat Kondo Isami in a match. After losing\\nto Tennen Rishin Ryu, Yamanami decided to retrain under Kondo and entered the Shieikan. This\\nwas probably around 1860. Later he was said to have taught classes on Kondo&#8217;s behalf. Shinsengumi Years - Although he began in the Shinsengumi at the same rank as Hijikata, Yamanami gradually began\\nto fade into the background. Even before Ikeda-ya he was playing no real role in leading the\\ngroup anymore. The most enduring legend about him is how he met his death. The most widely known version of the story has it that Yamanami was unhappy with the way\\nKondo and Hijikata ran the Shinsengumi. He is also said to have felt that they were abandoning\\ntheir true and original purpose of &#8220;Sonno-Joi&#8221; or &#8220;Revere the Emperor and Expel the\\nBarbarians&#8221;. Things began to come to a head after Ikeda-ya, when the other two men began to\\nmake plans to move the headquarters from Mibu to the Nishihongan-ji Temple. Although\\nYamanami complained about it bitterly, saying that it was not an appropriate place for executions\\nand the like, he was ignored. At that point he decided on drastic actions. Writing a brief note, he left the group without permission on February 22, 1865 [March 19, 1865]\\nand headed to Otsu. As soon they realized that he was gone, Okita took a horse and went after\\nhim. An often speculated reason for sending him is that they did not really want for Yamanami to\\nbe captured. But at an inn in Otsu, find him Okita did. He was not even trying to really escape.\\nAlthough the captain is often said to have urged him to flee, Yamanami insisted on being taken\\nback to Mibu to face his punishment. Some have it that Nagakura and Ito tried to give him a second chance to escape once they\\nreturned to headquarters. Again Yamanami declined, saying that he had already made up his\\nmind. At the Maekawa estate the very next day, February 23, 1865 [March 20, 1865], Hijikata\\nordered Yamanami to commit seppuku. Okita served as his second. The reasons for his actions are unknown. Some say that he simply wished to die. Others that he\\nwanted his death to serve as a warning to Kondo. However this is only the generally known\\nversion of what happened to Yamanami. The truth may have been very different. First off it is questioned exactly what the nature of Hijikata and Yamanami&#8217;s relationship was.\\nTraditionally it has been said that they despised one another. Hijikata would complain that\\nYamanami was a &#8220;fox&#8221; and a &#8220;pain in the rear&#8221; for Kondo. And for his part Yamanami may have\\nbeen jealous of the close relationship that the other Vice-commander had with the Commander.\\nYet there is also those who say that the two really respected one another. And there is evidence\\nthat this was true, at least before they came to Kyoto. Hijikata is supposed to have dedicated one\\nof his poems to Yamanami while they were at the Shieikan together. As for the day that Yamanami &#8220;escaped&#8221;, the samurai of other domains reported seeing many of\\nthe Shinsengumi leaving their headquarters. This could mean that Okita was actually not the only\\none sent to bring him back or it may be that something entirely different may have happened to\\nYamanami which caused his death. It is claimed that Yamanami was suffering from some sort of neurosis at the time of his death.\\nThis may have been because his physical condition was not so good. There is a story that in\\n1864, around the time of the New Year&#8217;s Holidays, Yamanami went to help Kondo stop a burglar\\nat a shop in Kyoto. It is supposed that he either received a serious wound on his back during this\\nincident or else that he fell seriously ill just afterwards. Which ever one of the two it may have\\nbeen, something seems to have caused him to no longer be able to participate in the group&#8217;s\\nactivities afterwards. He was given an &#8220;honorary&#8221; post at this time because he was forced from\\nthe front lines. Unable to do his job, he fell into a gloomy depression. Apparently his condition was serious enough that he was still unable to fight at Ikeda-ya. Illness\\nis cited as the reason for his absence there. While this raises the possibility that it was a sickness\\nthat pushed him to the sidelines after the New Year&#8217;s incident, it could have also been due to a\\ndeteriorating condition if he had indeed received a physical injury that permanently disabled him.\\nFor this reason he felt that he was useless to the group and was no longer able to influence it&#8217;s\\npolicies. It was this constant brooding over his health and change in circumstances that may have\\nfinally led him to take his own life. The real truth of Yamanami&#8217;s death will most likely always remain a mystery. There were many who regretted his death. He was buried at Kouenji Temple, where he had been\\non friendly terms with the chief priest. (This was because Yamanami&#8217;s family crest and the one\\nthe temple used were the same.) Lots of people from Mibu as well as the Shinsengumi members\\nattended his funeral. Love Life - Another enduring legend about Yamanami is the love affair he had with a Tenjin of Shimabara\\nnamed Akesato. (A Tenjin was the second highest ranking class of prostitute at that time in\\nKyoto.) Although she was not extremely beautiful, she was considered to have been an elegant\\nperson. The day that he was to commit seppuku, the ceremony was delayed long enough for\\nNagakura to run to Shimabara and fetch Akesato. She came to the Maekawa estate and said a\\nfinal, tearful farewell to him at the lattice window beside the main gate. This is all that is known\\nof Akesato. The problem is that she may have never existed at all. There is no record of such a person\\nworking in Shimabara under that name at the time the Shinsengumi were in Kyoto. It is possible\\nthat such records may have been lost over time, but even worse is the fact that the sole source of\\nthis story is the work of Shimozawa Kan, who many suspect may have fabricated much of the\\n&#8220;history&#8221; he recorded about the Shinsengumi. Shimozawa claimed to have seen a record left by\\nSaito Hajime from which he got many of his details about the group, but no one since has been\\nable to find any trace of this book and so his story is suspect. Perhaps just as incriminating is the\\nfact that Nagakura, the person who was supposed to have gone to get Akesato that day, does not\\nmention such an episode at all. However the issue of whether or not she truly existed will most likely be debated for a long time\\nto come.

(lower mansion) of the Shirakawa clan in Edo. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[The Shirakawa clan mansion was located in the Roppongi area of Tokyo.] Died - May 30, 1868 in Sentagaya, Edo at either age 27 or 25. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [July 19, 1868 in Sentagaya, Tokyo at either age 26 or 24.] Names - Imina - Kaneyoshi (Fusanaga) Childhood Name - Okita Sojiro It is generally considered that he shortened his name from &#8220;Sojiro&#8221; to &#8220;Soji&#8221; around the time he\\njoined the others in the Roshitai. It has also been suggested that Kondo may have called him this\\nfor short. There are some who refer to him as &#8220;Soushi&#8221;, but this name is not correct. Physical Description - Okita had a dark complexion, broad shoulders which may have had a bit of a stoop, and he was\\nlean even before his illness. He was also in reality not very handsome, having what is described\\nas a &#8220;flatfish face&#8221;. In height he was much taller than is generally depicted, perhaps either 166cm\\nor 170cm (5\\'6\" or 5\\'7\"). Considering that he was supposed to be taller than Hijikata, probably the\\n170cm estimate is more correct. His voice is described as having been high-pitched and thin. This is far from the image of the &#8220;cute young boy&#8221; created by Shiba Ryotaro in &#8220;Moeyo Ken&#8221;.\\nHowever it does not seem to have bothered the young ladies of Okita&#8217;s time one bit. Personality Quirks and Traits - It is said that Okita tended to eat very lightly and would even leave banquets early. There&#8217;s a\\npossibility he had an unbalanced diet because of this. He was also known to have liked to drink,\\nthough perhaps not quite as much as some of his fellow Shinsengumi. It was rare for Okita to become serious. When he did it was usually because he was involved in a\\nfight. At such times he could be ruthless. He was also known to have been short-tempered when training. Once inside a dojo his students\\nfeared him more than Kondo because of his strict and rough manner. He was very particular\\nabout swordsmanship and that made it hard for his students to please him. It is speculated that\\nsince he was so skilled, he may have had trouble understanding human clumsiness and weakness\\nwithout ability. For the most part however he was someone who was always smiling. In Kyoto he would always\\njoke around and try to make everyone else laugh. Generally he was successful. It has become legendary how Okita kept his sense of humor to the very end. Even in the final\\nstages of TB Okita never lost his ability to smile, something for which he is still admired. The\\nway in which he lived - and died - perhaps shows that the most powerful forms of courage are\\nnot to be found on any battlefield after all. Family History - Okita&#8217;s father was Okita Katsujiro, an ashigaru kogashira (foot soldier captain) for the Shirakawa\\nclan at their lower mansion in Edo. He passed away when his son was only about four. About his\\nmother, nothing is known. He had two older sisters. The eldest was Mitsu, who seems to have raised Okita. She married\\nInoue Rintaro, who changed his name to Okita Rintaro. He was somehow related to Inoue\\nGenzaburo and that probably explains how Okita later ended up at the Shieikan. The second sister was Kin. She married a samurai from Edo. His name may have been Yoshihide\\nNagano and he may have been from the Mineyama province. Before the Shinsengumi - It is not known for certain in what year Okita was born. For a long time the year 1844 was\\naccepted because this is what the family said. However a public document that recorded his entry\\ninto the Roshitai gives his birthyear as 1842. Because it was an officially recorded record, many\\nnow believe this was the correct year of his birth. Family legend has it that Okita was born during either a terrible thunderstorm or during a solar\\neclipse. And it appears that there was indeed a solar eclipse in June of 1842, the year now most\\ncommonly given as his birthyear. He was very close to Kondo from the time that he first joined the Shieikan, but his real\\nrelationship with Hijikata is not as certain. Probably the story that they were &#8220;like brothers&#8221; is\\nexaggerated, but there is evidence that they were at least friendly with each other. At any rate\\nHijikata used to accompany him as his assistant when he would give lessons at the Sato house or\\nin Onoji so that he could visit his relatives. This meant that the two had to be able to work\\ntogether and spent a great deal of time in each other&#8217;s company at any rate. Okita would often help the Sato family by cleaning the dojo for them, working in the garden, or\\nrunning errands. He may have even been given &#8220;pocket money&#8221; by Hijikata&#8217;s sister, Nobu. In the middle of July, 1862 and less than a year before joining the Roshitai, Okita became\\nseriously sick with measles while teaching at the home of a student. This may have possibly\\nweakened his immune system, making him more susceptible to the TB which would eventually\\nclaim his life. Martial Skills- Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Kondo Shusuke and Kondo Isami, Shieikan dojo Okita is supposed to have joined the Shieikan when he was around the age of 9 [8], due to his\\nfamily&#8217;s poor status. Considering which birthyear is used, this means he either joined in the\\nspring of 1850 or that he joined in 1852. He had a natural ability when it came to swordsmanship and it was said he could use a katana\\n(Japanese sword), bokken (wooden training sword), or a shinai (bamboo training sword) equally\\nwell. There is a story that when he was around the age of 12, he defeated the fencing instructor of\\nthe Shirakawa clan. By the time the group went to Kyoto, Okita had reached full mastership of\\nTennen Rishin Ryu. Like Kondo, Okita traveled all around the Tama area to give lessons for the Shieikan. One can\\nspeculate that many of his students did not look forward to these at all because of his strict nature\\nas a teacher. His famous personally developed technique was the &#8220;sandanzuki&#8221; or &#8220;three-part thrust&#8221;. This\\nmove involved a strike to the neck, then the left shoulder followed by the right shoulder. It is said\\nthat he could deliver these thrusts in very quick succession. Another technique he favored was the &#8220;seigan&#8221; stance. In Tennen Rishin Ryu it started out with\\nhim holding the grip in front of his belly and the tip pointed at the opponent&#8217;s throat. He would\\nthen pull back his left shoulder slightly and move his left foot out so that he took a slanted stance.\\nThe apparent aim of this stance was to draw out an opponent by making him think he saw an\\nopening, then delivering a quick thrust. His Sword(s) - Long Sword - Kiyomitsu Kaga - 74cm in length Long Sword - Kikuichi Norimune - 2\\'4\"2 The Kiyomitsu Kaga was described as being a very practical sword and was a blade that Okita\\nvery definitely owned. He was using this particular sword during the fight at Ikeda-ya, but the\\npoint broke off during the battle. He was probably never able to use it again afterwards. The Kikuichi Norimune that legend says he owned is far more questionable. This was an\\nextremely sought after and expensive sword that even many daimyo could not have afforded. If\\nOkita did have such a blade, then it would have been a gift from someone very wealthy. Some claim that the sword he actually owned was a Yamato no Kami Yasusada, made by a 17 th \\ncentury swordsmith in Musashi. Though it was a good deal less expensive than a Norimune, it\\nwas still a fairly famous blade and highly doubtful that he could have really owned one. One of the reasons that no one can determine what sort of blade he really had was because it has\\nbeen lost. There are several stories about what happened to Okita&#8217;s sword. One version has it that\\nafter his death, his sister Mitsu was going somewhere with it while riding in a rickshaw. She\\naccidently forgot the sword when she got out and was never able to recover it again. Shinsengumi Years - Okita started in the Mibu Roshi as a captain and held this position until the start of the Boshin\\nWar, when his illness forced him to stop fighting. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was the\\nCaptain of the First Unit and a teacher of kenjutsu. Aside from being a major joker, Okita is most remembered for playing with the local children at\\nMibudera. He was also one of the three strongest swordsman in the group, along with Nagakura\\nand Saito. There is much debate on whether he or Saito deserves the title of the &#8220;The Strongest&#8221;. During the raid at Ikeda-ya, it is said that Okita fainted from lung trouble. It is not clear whether\\nthis was the first sign of his having tuberculosis or if this was a different ailment. Once it was\\ndiscovered that he was sick with the disease, it was kept a secret for as long as possible. However\\nby the time of the Battle of Toba-Fushimi is had progressed to the point to where he was no\\nlonger able to fight. He had to wait with Kondo for them to return to Osaka and just before they\\nleft by boat for Edo, he was so sick that he was bedridden. He went to see Matsumoto with\\nKondo as soon as they arrived in the city. There are at least two different locations where Okita was supposed to have been taken while\\ntrying to recover from his tuberculosis. One may have been the often referred to &#8220;tuberculosis\\nhospital&#8221;. &#160; A more definite location is the house of one Uekiya Heigoro in Sentagaya, Edo, near the Ikejiri\\nbridge. Looking out from the gate of the house, one could see the bridge. There were a lot of\\nhuge old trees at the time, one of them being a large cedar. On the far side of the stream, on the\\nright-hand side was a watermill. This was considered to be a rather scary place after dark that\\nwas frequented by supernatural animals such as fox and tanuki (raccoon dogs). Okita was given a\\ndetached room looking out onto the garden. When Kondo and Hijikata marched to Kofu, Okita was feeling well enough to go with them as\\nfar as Tama. He visited the Sato family and entertained everyone by doing an impression of a\\nsumo wrestler&#8217;s stamp. However he took a turn for the worse soon after and had to be sent back\\nto Edo. During his final days Okita asked repeatedly about Kondo, but no one would tell him that the\\nCommander had been captured and executed. Matsumoto is said to have tended him during this\\ntime, but it is very likely that the doctor was actually in Aizu by this time. It is the story that says he was at the Uekiya house that mentions the episode with the black cat.\\nEvery day at the same time this creature would come into the garden and stare at Okita. On the\\nday that he died, May 30, 1868 [July 19, 1868], Okita had made up his mind to kill the animal\\nand dragged himself out onto the engawa (veranda) in the attempt. It was here that they found his\\nbody. One reason why he may have wanted to kill it was because black cats were supposed to be omens\\nof impending death for those with tuberculosis. There are many other superstitions though that\\nmight also account for his actions. Okita&#8217;s grave is in the Roppongi area of Tokyo at the Senshouji Temple. This is very close to\\nwhere the Shirakawa clan mansion he was born in once stood. Love Life - Matsumoto Ryojun was of the opinion that Okita was a &#8220;seidouji&#8221; or &#8220;the clean child&#8221;, meaning\\nthat he was a virgin. He was not alone in this thought and there are many who claim Okita never\\nhad any relations with women or that at least he did not associate with them very much. There\\nare other accounts however, which would suggest otherwise. The first woman problem Okita ever had is said to have &#160;took place while he was still at the\\nShieikan. There was a young woman who was somehow connected to the dojo at the time and\\nshe did the cleaning and washing there. Her name and age are unknown, but she was said to have\\nbeen a &#8220;spunky&#8221; woman. She took a liking to Okita and eventually told him she wanted to be his\\nwife. His response was to decline, saying that he was still training himself. The poor girl was so\\nshocked that she tried to kill herself by stabbing herself in the neck. However she missed hitting\\na vital point and did not die. She later married into another family with the help of the Kondo\\nfamily. Then there is the mysterious grave at Kouenji Temple in Kyoto which has a grave carved with\\nthe words &#8220;Okita&#8217;s relation&#8221;. The &#8220;kaimyo&#8221; belongs to a woman and she passed away ahead of\\nhim. (She may have been buried on April 26, 1867 [May 29, 1867].) As far as can be known, Okita had no relatives at all in Kyoto. For this reason it is thought that\\nshe may have been his lover, but that she could not marry him for some reason. One rumor has it\\nthat she was the daughter of a doctor. (A separate story mentioned that Okita was dating such a\\nwoman, but that Kondo made him break off the relationship. Whether it has any connection to\\nthis woman was not clear.) Another legend about the mystery woman is that she bore Okita a\\ndaughter. Unfortunately there is no record of a child or what might have become of her if she did\\nexist. Perhaps she really was the daughter of a doctor and Okita was forced to break off their\\nrelationship by Kondo, which would explain why they could not marry. Perhaps by then she was\\nalready pregnant and died in childbirth, a common occurrence back in those days. One can\\nspeculate endlessly, but the woman at Kouenji Temple has carried her secrets with her to the\\ngrave and is unlikely to give them up now.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [May 31, 1835 in Ishida, Hino, Tokyo.] Died - May 11, 1869 in Hakodate, Ezo at age 35. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [June 20, 1869 in Hakodate, Hokkaido at age 34.] Names - Imina - Yoshitoyo Penname - Hogyoku Alternate Name - Naito Hayato Kaimyo - Saishin-inden-seizan-yoshitoyo-daikoji Hijikata took the name &#8220;Naito Hayato&#8221; when he became a high-ranking retainer of the Tokugawa\\non March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868]. The first name, Hayato, seems to have been chosen because\\nit was part of his father&#8217;s name. However he reverted back to his original name after Kondo was\\ncaptured and executed. His &#8220;kaimyo&#8221; was chosen by Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu. It contains the elements &#8220;inden&#8221; and\\n&#8220;daikoji&#8221; which were normally only used for daimyo and the like. As the son of a farmer, this\\nwas a huge honor that was granted toward him. The fact that he could use his surname openly before the end of his life was another oddity. At\\nthe beginning of the Edo period, the shogunate had abolished the right of anyone below the social\\nrank of samurai to have a surname. For many this was not a problem since they did not have a\\nfamily name anyway. However leading families such as Hijikata&#8217;s did have one and were forced\\nto make them into &#8220;secret names&#8221; known only to themselves and to very close friends in much\\nthe same manner as their &#8220;imina&#8221; or &#8220;hidden personal names&#8221;. It was not until he went to Kyoto\\nthat Hijikata was able to use his surname openly. Physical Description - Hijikata was considered to have &#8220;looked like an actor&#8221; and to have been handsome almost to the\\npoint of being beyond belief. He turned the heads of women wherever he went and many fell in\\nlove with him on sight. His complexion was pale and his hair was so black that it was almost\\nblue. In height he was around 165cm - 167cm tall (about 5\\'5\" - 5\\'6\"), which was tall compared to\\nmost men of his era when the average height was between 154cm - 158cm (5\\'0\" - 5\\'1\"). The\\n165cm is probably closer to his real height since Okita was said to have been taller than he was.\\nHe also had a slight &#8220;stoop&#8221; to his shoulders. In his dress he appears to have been very tasteful. One person who saw him while he was in\\nKyoto claimed that he looked like a daimyo. On that occasion he had been wearing a black\\ncrested kimono and a hakama of sendaihara silk. Personality Quirks and Traits - Hijikata is known for his hobby of writing haiku under the name &#8220;Hogyoku&#8221;. Before leaving for\\nKyoto he compiled everything that he had written into a collection which he left with his family.\\nMost who have read his work say that it is not very good. It is thought that he was fond of ume (variously translated as plum or apricot, but not really\\neither) since many of his haiku had references to the flowers. There was also a blossom carved on\\nthe tsuba (handguard) of his sword and the saya (sheath) is also decorated with a few as well. His\\nfavorite color was said to be red and even the face mask he wore in training was tied with a red\\ncord. One of Hijikata&#8217;s favorite foods was takuwan (pickled radish), especially the ones made by\\nhis Hashimoto relatives. Once while visiting with them he praised it so much that the master of\\nthe house told him he could take home as many as he thought he would need. This made Hijikata\\nvery happy and he took the whole bucket with him! (Note that takuwan is said to have a very\\nstrong smell and that the bucket was probably fairly big since the incident was remembered.) Hijikata is often referred to as the &#8220;Onifukuchou&#8221; or &#8220;Demon Vice-commander&#8221; of the\\nShinsengumi because of his cruel nature. In reality this does not appear to have been the case.\\nRather the notion is mostly the creation of the novel &#8220;Moeyo Ken&#8221; by Shiba Ryotaro. As for the real man, it is recorded that in character he was a plain, frank person who spoke little\\nand rarely laughed or smiled. In Hakodate it was observed that he never behaved in any manner\\nthat was not completely befitting a samurai even in private. This natural reserve caused many to\\nthink of him as being stricter than he really was. Hijikata is frequently described by those who met him as having been a kind and amiable man.\\nOne visitor to the Shinsengumi reported that even sitting face-to-face with the Vice-commander\\nnever seemed in any way unpleasant and that he was actually a &#8220;friendly-feeling person&#8221;. By the\\ntime that he went to Hakodate this trait had become even more noticeable and Shinsengumi\\nmember Nakajima Nobori wrote of how &#8220;gentle&#8221; he became in his later years in the inscription of\\nhis famous portrait of Hijikata. This is not to say that he had a bland personality. As a leader he was charismatic, inspiring\\nloyalty and trust in his followers. His troops in Hakodate adored him and one later recalled that\\nupon hearing of his death they all &#8220;cried like babes who had lost their mother&#8221;. Even during the years in Kyoto those under him do not appear to have found his methods to be\\noverly drastic or forceful. Matsumoto Ryojun, a doctor for the Tokugawa government who\\nsometimes tended to the Shinsengumi, was of the opinion that the group would have fell apart\\nmuch sooner if not for Hijikata. His presence was generally enough to keep Kondo from making\\nserious mistakes that would have made it impossible for the Commander to have good relations\\nwith the rest of the group. And when the petition was filed against Kondo by Nagakura and\\nothers, not one word was said against Hijikata. Although many sources report that as a child he was a &#8220;spoiled brat&#8221; and a &#8220;bully&#8221; to strangers,\\nbut so far there is not a ready explanation of where the idea came from. Those who knew him\\nseem to have regarded him as a good boy actually and when tales about the amount of\\nbloodletting he was responsible for in Kyoto reached Tama they were not believed. And an often\\nrepeated comment about him in Hakodate is that he &#8220;returned to his original nature&#8221; there,\\nimplying that he was considered to have been a gentle person before leaving for Kyoto. Possibly\\nhis refusal to remain at the shop in Edo is the basis of this claim that he was a &#8220;brat&#8221;. &#160; A little more on the negative side, Hijikata&#8217;s infamy apparently amused him to some degree. He\\nalso seems to have had a bit of a dark and quirky sense of humor at times. On a visit home he\\nshocked people by claiming that one of his swords had been ruined by all the blood from his\\nmany fights. On another occasion he sent a package to the students training at the Shieikan with a\\nnote saying, &#8220;I send you something precious.&#8221; When they opened it, they discovered that it\\ncontained a bundle of love letters that women in Kyoto had written to the Vice-commander. The\\nyouths found this very funny and declared that, &#8220;Toshi-san gains another point!&#8221; Though for the most part Hijikata was very calm and never acted rashly in the face of danger. It\\nwas very rare for him to lose his temper over anything and he was considered to be a tolerant\\nperson. However a shogunate scholar of western studies named Kato Hiroyuki commented that\\nonce Hijikata did become angry about something, he was even stormier than Kondo. Of the two,\\nthe shogunate found the Vice-commander much more difficult to control. There are many testaments left about his courage on the battlefield and he was said to have been\\nthe bravest man in Ezo during the fighting there. He was even better known for his skills as a\\nstrategist and his efficiency in getting tasks done. A relative named Hashimoto Masano recalled\\nthat Hijikata had read many books, but that his knowledge of warfare seemed to have been an\\ninborn thing with him. Another to be impressed with his martial skills was Frenchman Jules\\nBrunet. He referred to Hijikata as &#8220;a true warrior&#8221; and speculated that had he been in a European\\narmy, he would have been made a general. Another trait worth mentioning was his practicality. He easily adopted new ideas if their worth\\ncould be proven to him. During the time the Shinsengumi was active in Kyoto, eating meat was\\nnot a common practice. But when Matsumoto told Hijikata of the nutritional value of adding\\npork and chicken to their diet, the Vice-commander ordered his men to begin raising the animals\\nfor food. Katsu Kaishu perhaps summed up this remarkable individual best when he called Hijikata &#8220;one\\nman of great caliber.&#8221; Family History - Father - Yoshiatsu (Hayato) - 1792-1835, age 44 [43]. Mother - Etsu - 1792-1840, age 49 [48]. First Son - Tamejiro - 1812-1883, age 72 [71]. Second Son - no name - October 11, 1813 (premature death). Third Son - no name - June 12, 1815 (premature death). Fourth Son - Kiroku - 1819-1860, age 42 [41]. First Daughter - no name - August 4, 1821 (premature death). Second Daughter - no name - May 5, 1822 (premature death). Third Daughter - Shuu - 1823-1838, age 16 [15]. Fifth Son - Daisaku - 1828-1877, age 50 [49]. Fourth Daughter - Nobu - 1831-1877, age 47 [46]. Sixth Son - Toshizo - 1835-1869, age 35 [34]. Hijikata&#8217;s father died several months before he was born. It appears that the cause of his death\\nmay have been tuberculosis. His sister Shuu is also rumored to have been isolated for the disease\\nbefore she passed away in 1838, when Hijikata was 4 [3]. Two years later his mother passed\\naway and TB is again speculated to have been the cause of her death. Hijikata was only 6 [5] at\\nthe time. Tamejiro, the eldest son, was blind and unable to inherit the family property. He was a refined\\nperson who enjoyed joruri and tanaka and was probably the inspiration for Hijikata&#8217;s own\\nattempts at haiku. He also never let his handicap get in his way. On one occasion when he was\\nreturning home from a brothel he found that the Tamagawa (Tama river) had flooded. Instead of\\nstopping he merely wound his clothes on top of his head and waded across. Kiroku inherited his father&#8217;s estate as the next oldest son. It was he and his wife who raised\\nHijikata after the death of their mother. (He lived with Kiroku up until about the age of 11.)\\nKiroku&#8217;s attempt to set his little brother up in a career with a major store in Edo unfortunately\\nfailed because Hijikata would not co-operate and this perhaps strained their relationship a bit. He\\ndid not live to see Hijikata become a success in the Shinsengumi, passing away in 1860 - three\\nyears before the group was to form. Daisaku was adopted by another family which practiced medicine. He changed his name to\\nKasuya Ryojun and became a doctor. He apparently had excellent calligraphy skills and is\\nthought to have written the sign outside of the Shinsengumi&#8217;s headquarters in Mibu. Nobu married a cousin named Sato Hikogoro. Sato&#8217;s mother, Masa, was their father&#8217;s sister and\\nit was her wish that Nobu and Hikogoro marry. After losing the job Kiroku had gotten for him,\\nHijikata lived more often at the Sato house. Hikogoro was described as a &#8220;stout-hearted&#8221; person\\nand the two of them got along very well. Sato also had a dojo built in his home to study Tennen\\nRishin Ryu because he was concerned about bandits and thieves. It was Kondo Isami who would\\ncome to teach these classes, which is how Hijikata first got to know him. Though the Hijikata family were wealthy farmers of the Tama region. They lived in the Ishida\\nvillage in Tama, Musashi province. Originally they had lived north of Ishida temple, but were\\nlater forced to move to another house near Mangan-ji Temple. The reason was the massive\\nflooding of the Tamagawa in the June of 1846. Part of their property was severely damaged.\\nHijikata was 12 [11] at the time. In 1989 it was deemed impossible to save this second family\\nhome any longer and the place was torn down, though the Hijikata family still owns the property\\nand rebuilt there. Takahatasan Kongo-ji Temple (Takahata Fudoson) was their family temple. It is of the Shingon\\nSect and one of the three great Fudo temples in the Kanto region. A statue of Hijikata in his\\nShinsengumi uniform now stands on the grounds next to the Benten pond. Hijikata&#8217;s family also had relatives in the village of Onoji who were named Hashimoto. When he\\nwent to the village to teach later on, he would often stay with a Hashimoto Michisuke. This may\\nhave been the person who gave him the takuwan. There was also a Hashimoto Masanao. The\\nfamily was indirectly related to Kojima Shikanosuke through a grandmother in the Hashimoto\\nfamily. (Ages of the Hijikata family in 1835.) Father - deceased Mother - 44 [43] Tamejiro - 24 [23] Kiroku - 17 [16] Shuu - 13 [12] Daisaku - 8 [7] Nobu - 5 [4] Before the Shinsengumi - When he was around 11 years old, Hijikata planted an arrow bamboo plant on the family\\nproperty with the wish that he could become a samurai and win a reputation. The arrow bamboo\\nis still growing today and stands proudly near the entrance of a datahall attached to the family\\nhome where many important Shinsengumi mementos are kept. Also at the datahall is a pillar that\\nwas rescued from the old house. Hijikata would use it to practice the &#8220;harite&#8221; or &#8220;slapping&#8221; of\\nsumo wrestling. Around 1845, when Hijikata was 11 [10], Kiroku got him a job at a shop in Ueno, Edo called the\\nIto-Gofukuten. (This store is now called Matsuzakaya and is a very high-class place.) It sold\\nkimono fabric and had a &#8220;men only&#8221; household. As a younger brother, Hijikata himself could\\ninherit nothing and so was very poor himself. Kiroku obviously wanted to ensure that he could\\nsomeday be independent and most likely went through a lot of trouble to make this arrangement\\nfor him. Unfortunately these plans had been made without reckoning with Hijikata himself. Soon after being brought to the shop he quarreled with one of the clerks (some stories say it was\\nactually the owner) and ran away. He returned to Tama along the Kousiyuu Highway, which was\\na distance of 36km (a bit over 22 miles) from his home. The walk took him about 10 hours and\\nhe had to make it at night. He never returned to the store. Needless to say, this sort of betrayed\\nhis older brother&#8217;s expectations of him and it may have been difficult for him to return to the\\nHijikata house. It was at this point that he began to live most often at the Sato house. In 1851, at age 17 [16], he got another job at a shop that was a branch of the other Matsuzakaya.\\nBecause of his good looks, they made him sit near the storefront to attract customers into the\\nshop. He was noted to have been very good with scissors. However this job did not last long\\neither because he was caught messing around with a female co-worker and fired. He would later\\nobserve that he simply did not have the temperament to be a merchant. Sato scolded him over losing yet another job, but Hijikata quickly came up with a solution\\nhimself. He began to peddle the medicines made by the Hijikata and Sato families. On these trips\\nhe would carry his fencing equipment so that he could take lessons at the various dojo he stopped\\nat while plying his trade. In this was he could earn money and still pursue his true interest and\\nthis time he was successful. He continued to do this until formally enrolling in the Shieikan in\\n1859. On November 6, 1861, Hijikata was at the Sato house when he became seriously ill. His brother\\nKasuya Ryojun (Daisaku) was called to attend to him and three days later the doctor son of\\nanother family acquaintance was brought in to check on him. Although it is unknown exactly\\nwhat was wrong with him, he was dangerously sick and almost died. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Mokuroku Teacher - Kondo Shusuke, Shieikan dojo It is not certain exactly when Hijikata joined the Shieikan. Kojima Shikanosuke recorded that he\\nentered the dojo at about age 17, but the school&#8217;s records do not mention him. They do show that\\nhe was formally enrolled in 1859, at age 25 [24]. It may be that he was informally associated with\\nthe dojo before that time. Also, Hijikata does not appear to have ever earned a Menkyo (license) in Tennen Rishin Ryu. He\\nis recorded as only have received a Mokuroku, the next to the lowest level. Despite his skill with\\na sword, all of the lessons he took at the dojo he visited while peddling medicine caused him to\\nhave the form of various sword styles mixed into his swordsmanship. It was said that Kondo\\nShusuke did not regard this mixed sword style as good and undoubtedly he would have been\\nmade to start all over again. Still, he was considered to be a formidable opponent and his enemies\\ndid not take him lightly. His Sword(s) - Long Sword - Izumi no Kami Fujiwara Kanesada - 2\\'8\" Short Sword - Kunihiro Horikawa - 1\\'11\"5 Toshizo&#8217;s favorite blade was made by a swordsmith from Aizu. It is now on display in his family\\nhome in Ishida, where he is believed to have left it on his way to Kofu castle. His supposed short\\nsword, the Kunihiro Horikawa, was a blade that was generally something only a daimyo or the\\nlike could afford. For this reason it is speculated that Hijikata&#8217;s may have been a forgery. When they set out for Kyoto, Hijikata did not have a sword and had to borrow one. However it is\\nrecorded that by October of 1863 he was supposed to have already possessed both the Kanesada\\nand Kunihiro Horikawa. Considering that the Kanesada was made by a swordsmith living in\\nAizu at that time, it is likely that the domain provided him with this blade. Shinsengumi Years - Started out in the Mibu Roshi as a Vice-commander along with Yamanami Keisuke. After\\nYamanami&#8217;s death he continued to fill this role alone. On March 1, 1868 [March 24, 1868] he\\nbecame a high-ranking retainer of the Tokugawa. Later on he served as the Vice-commander of\\nthe army in the Republic of Ezo. Hijikata helped to form the Shinsengumi at age 29 [28] and is commonly thought to have been\\nthe soul of the group. But despite all of his contributions to their success, he never sought replace\\nKondo as the leader. Instead he tended to treat the Commander in the manner he would have an\\nolder brother. One of the items on display at the datahall in Ishida is a metal forehead protector that he wore\\nduring the political change on August 18, 1863 [September 30, 1863]. At this time the group\\nbecame the Shinsengumi and began to gain some measure of respectability. Hijikata was of\\ncourse delighted with the turnabout in their fortunes. When an old friend, Tomizawa Mashiro,\\nvisited the group in Kyoto, the Vice-commander entrusted this item to him and requested that he\\ntake it back to his family in Tama as a memento, along with a letter that he wrote them. Looking\\nat it closely, one can see a small sword scar on the front of it, proving that this piece of\\nequipment did its job on at least one occasion. Considering that the Shinsengumi did not actually\\nfight on that day, the mark was either put there during another scuffle or it may have been a used\\npiece of equipment and so was already scratched when it came to him. In his free time, Hijikata seems to have liked to play shogi (or go according to some) with Okita.\\nIt is remarked that all the other members would gather around to watch the game and that\\neveryone seems to have enjoyed these matches very much. The battle of Toba-Fushimi would have a profound effect on Hijikata. Immediately after being\\ndefeated by western weapons, he decided to take the best of both the modern and the samurai\\nworld. He cut his long hair and began to dress in french clothing. He also began to carry a\\nrevolver as well as his sword. In this he serves as an example of what samurai may have become\\nhad the Meiji government not put an end to the warrior class. Not long after the defeat at Kofu, Kondo was captured and executed as a common criminal by the\\nimperial army. This event left Hijikata consumed with guilt over his failure to save his friend and\\nonly strengthened his own resolve to fight to the death. He told others that he would be too\\nembarrassed to face Kondo in the next life if he were to make peace with his enemies. It was at some point during this time period that the two pictures of him were likely taken. No\\none knows exactly when or where this occurred. Sendai is one possibility. Another is that at least\\none of the pictures was taken in a studio in Hakodate where many of the other members of the\\nRepublic of Ezo had their portraits taken. At least one of these pictures was sent by him to the\\nSato family through his page, Ichimura Tetsunosuke. On May 11, 1869 [June 20, 1869], the Meiji army began its invasion of Hakodate. Hijikata was\\nunwilling to abandon members of the Shinsengumi who were guarding a fort called Benten\\nDaiba. Instead of remaining at Goryokaku, he made a desperate attempt to get to the other fort\\nand encountered enemy troops. He was killed on horseback by a bullet which struck him in the\\nabdomen and shattered his lower back. He seems to have been dead before any of his men could\\narrive at his side. It is unknown where Hijikata was buried. Love Life - Women were naturally drawn to the exceptionally handsome Hijikata and there is little doubt that\\nhe was well aware of this and took full advantage of his looks. Kondo once wrote in a letter that\\nthe Vice-commander was bragging about his numerous women. In addition, many of the higher\\nranking members had more than one home in Kyoto where they kept their lovers. Hijikata was\\nsaid to have been the worst offender in this regard. As mentioned before, he received many love letters from women in Kyoto. Another incident\\nwhich shows the sort of reaction he commonly caused is told of the time the Shinsengumi spent\\nin Goheishinden (now Adachi Ward, Tokyo) just after Kofu. Hijikata spent some of his time\\nfishing in the river there, while still using the name &#8220;Naito Hayato&#8221;. No one in the area knew that\\nhe was actually Hijikata Toshizo of the Shinsengumi, so his reputation was not an influence on\\nwhat happened next. Before long every girl in the village had gathered on the riverbank to watch\\nthe &#8220;handsome samurai&#8221;. It was agreed by all of them that he was &#8220;a nice man&#8221;. So just how bad was he when it came to the ladies? Even during the time he was at the Shieikan\\nhe was a regular visitor to Yoshiwara and had a woman there. In Kyoto there was a woman he\\nwould go to see in Shimabara, about three geisha in Gion, plus two or three more he would visit\\nin Shimmachi pleasure quarters of Osaka. Also there was another woman who may have been\\nnamed something like &#8220;Kotsuru&#8221; or something to this effect. (The translator was not very clear\\non these names.) Yet another lover was a woman who may have been called something along the lines of &#8220;Okiku&#8221;.\\nAccording to rumor she actually had a daughter by Hijikata, but the baby died soon after it was\\nborn. After this the woman said goodbye to him and married another man. It is said that she died\\nvery young. At first glance it is easy to get the impression that Hijikata was merely shallow when it came to\\nwomen. However there was one relationship that he had before leaving Edo that proves\\notherwise. Before leaving for Kyoto, he was engaged to be married to a woman named Okoto.\\nThe arrangement had been made by his oldest brother, Tamejiro, who played the shamisen.\\nOkoto&#8217;s parents owned the shamisen shop that he often visited. Tamejiro introduced his brother\\nto Okoto and their families urged them to marry at once. For his part, Hijikata seems to have been agreeable to the marriage. However he was already\\nplanning to join the Roshitai with Kondo and the others at that point and was reluctant to give up\\nhis dream now that he was so close. So he said to them, &#8220;After winning a promotion, I want to\\ncarry out my marriage.&#8221; Once in Kyoto, he continued to appear to be sincere in his intentions to marry Okoto. He sent her\\na present and later visited her when he returned to Edo for a brief visit. But the social situation in\\nKyoto proved to be far more unstable than they had anticipated and when he finally did receive\\nthe &#8220;promotion&#8221; that he sought, he found that the Shinsengumi had put him in a position that\\nwould be dangerous for anyone involved with him. Hijikata felt that he had no choice but to\\ncancel the engagement. Although he had many lovers afterwards, he never again came close to making a commitment to\\nany of them. This would actually become the general policy of the Shinsengumi. Though there\\nwere exceptions to the rule, for the most part married men and family heirs would be discouraged\\nfrom joining the group. The risks were simply too great. By the time Hijikata went to Ezo, he was avoiding women altogether. As far as anyone knows, he\\nhad no children. Translation of the Inscription on the Portrait by Nakajima Nobori- &#8220;Hijikata was a man of great talent and integrity. In his later years, he became so gentle that\\npeople sought him in the way a baby seeks his mother. On the eleventh day of the fifth month of\\nMeiji 2 (1869), during the Hakodate Battle, he fought like a fierce tiger chasing after a helpless\\nflock of fleeing lambs. Taking several of his men, he forcefully headed into battle and was killed\\non his horse by a sniper. He was a great and noble man of his time.&#8221; (Source: sites.google.com ) \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n hijikata bio shinsengumi no makoto hakodate shinsengumi shinsengumi vice commander ikedaya toba fushimi kinmon kia kia at hakodate mia edo hino kyoto ezo shieikan tennen rishin ryu battle of hakodate boshin war friend of kondo love story kofu hijikata family serizawa assassination itou assassination \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n '", "title": "Hijikata Toshizo [shinsengumi-no-makoto]", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188360350941/hijikata-toshizo-shinsengumi-no-makoto"}, "188380261491": {"html": "b'<div id=\"post-188380261491\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"type\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380261491/the-japanese-english-bilingual-corpus-of\">Text</a>\\r\\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!-- .date -->\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"date\">\\r\\n                                October 16, 2019\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        -->\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380261491/the-japanese-english-bilingual-corpus-of\">The Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia&#8217;s Kyoto Articles - What?

How? \\r\\n hakuouki-history : Yesterday, I posted a translation of the 2010 Japanese wikipedia article about Hijikata Toshizo.&#160; I explained it came from the Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia&#8217;s Kyoto Articles . Now, there&#8217;s a mouthful. Today&#8217;s post is going to explain the nuts and bolts of using this resource. For a while now, I had noticed that when you googled Japanese historical names in English, you would often get hits from the Japanee English-learning website, Weblio. These hits would be translated sentences from Japanese Wikipedia. There were enough of them, and they were translated so well, that I realized someone somewhere had translated entire Wikipedia articles. And yet I couldn&#8217;t find the actual articles by googling. I did, however, find the articles. They are not, at the moment, in an easily accessible format. I hope that&#8217;ll change. But they are accessible to anyone and i&#8217;ll explain how to get the most out of them. First, though, what is this bilingual corpus?

You can follow links in the article to all sorts of related topics.&#160; If you&#8217;re interested, I have a much longer Japanese History Resources Thread on the Gintama fansite: Yorozuya Soul Forums, which focuses particularly on the Shinsengumi&#8217;s historical era: the Bakumatsu The books section is slowly being updated, but the Internet Resources section has a lot of stuff in it.&#160; \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n resources shinsengumi no makoto \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n '", "title": "Shinsengumi Resources Online", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380349456/shinsengumi-resources-online"}, "188380975616": {"html": "b'<div id=\"post-188380975616\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"type\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380975616/harada-sanosuke-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Text</a>\\r\\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!-- .date -->\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"date\">\\r\\n                                October 16, 2019\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        -->\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188380975616/harada-sanosuke-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Harada Sanosuke [shinsengumi-no-makoto]</a></h3>\\r\\n                            <p>Captain of the Tenth Unit<br></p><p>Born - 1840 in Iyo Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[Midori-cho, Matsuyama, Ehime]</p><p>Died - May 17, 1868 in Honjo, Sarue, Edo at age 29.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [July 6, 1868 in Tokyo at age 28.]</p><p>Names -</p><p>Imina - Tadakazu</p><p>Physical Description -</p><p>Harada is simply described as a tall, handsome man.

&#160; &#160;[Midori-cho, Matsuyama, Ehime] Died - May 17, 1868 in Honjo, Sarue, Edo at age 29. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [July 6, 1868 in Tokyo at age 28.] Names - Imina - Tadakazu Physical Description - Harada is simply described as a tall, handsome man. He had a seppuku scar that began on his left\\nside and ran across his stomach. Personality Quirks and Traits - He was a short-tempered, restless, and rash individual who often disobeyed his superiors. He\\ndisplayed some cleverness at reading and writing as a youth. When he would get drunk he would\\nshow off his seppuku scar and brag about being &#8220;indestructible&#8221;. Harada also changed his crest to\\na circle with one line through it to reflect his attempt at seppuku. He was the only man among the executive officers of the group to marry and was a considerate\\nand devoted husband. Family History - Harada was the second son of a lower samurai of the Iyo Matsuyama feudal clan. In March of 1865 he married a woman named Masa. She was the second daughter of a merchant\\nfamily named Sugawara. Their first son was born in 1866. Their second son was born in\\nDecember of 1867, but the child died eight days later. Before the Shinsengumi - In 1855 Harada went to Edo in the service of the Naitos family and worked as a &#8220;maintenance\\nman&#8221; in the daimyo&#8217;s second residence in that city. He was about 15 at that time. &#160;In 1857 he\\nreturned home and became a lesser retainer. It was during this period that he tried to commit seppuku over a trifle. Apparently he got into an\\naltercation with some men of higher rank who told him that he would not even be able to kill\\nhimself correctly. In his anger Harada tried to prove them wrong and cut himself. However the\\nwound was slight and he survived. Martial Skills - Spear Ryu - Taneda Houzouin Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Tani Sanjuro Harada apparently trained in the spear under Tani as his dojo in Osaka. Shinsengumi Years - Harada was with the group when the Mibu Roshi first formed and became a captain. He\\nmaintained this position until after the battle at Kofu, when he left with Nagakura. At the group&#8217;s\\nheight he was Captain of the Tenth Unit. Like Nagakura, Harada seems to have butted heads with Kondo on occasion. He was one of the\\nmembers who filed the petition against the commander. Later he left the group with the second\\ncaptain in April of 1867. Shortly after this he parted ways with Nagakura and joined the Shogitai, who were then in Ueno,\\nEdo to guard the Shogun. Harada was shot in the back during their battle with the Meiji\\ngovernment and passed away two days later on May 17, 1867 [July 6, 1867] at the age of 29 [28]. There are some who believe an alternate story, which claims that Harada became a bandit in\\nManchuria. According to this theory, he never joined the Shogitai and fled through Niigata to\\nChina, where he became the boss of mounted bandits and acted &#8220;violently&#8221;. This theory seems to\\nbe based on an encounter some Japanese soldiers had during the Sino-Japanese War (about 1894)\\nwith a man who may have been with the Shinsengumi. This person knew a lot about the group\\nthat was not supposed to be generally known, but there is no real proof that he was indeed\\nHarada.

&#160; &#160;[April 4, 1829 - Tokyo prefecture(?)] Died - January 4, 1868 in the Senbonmatsu area of Yodo, outside of Kyoto at age 39. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [January 28, 1868 at age 37.] Names - Imina - Kazushige Personality Traits and Quirks - Inoue was a gentle, warmhearted man and his good nature made him popular with the younger\\nmembers of the group. However he could be very stubborn at times and if he ever took a position\\non something then no amount of persuasion was going to budge him. He was also a taciturn\\nindividual and faithful till the end. It is said he was very friendly with Okita. Family History - Inoue was the third son of Inoue Matsugoro, the leader of a group known as the Hachioji Sennin\\nDoushin. The group was made up of families who had once been retainers of the Takeda clan.\\nAfter their leaders were defeated, the head of the Inoue family had made some bargain with the\\nTokugawa. While they did not become retainers, they were at the clan&#8217;s service as warriors. The\\nother part of their income came from farming. It appears that it was the second son of the family who succeeded their father. He changed his\\nname from Matsujiro to Matsugoro at this time. At the time the Shinsengumi first formed in\\nKyoto as the Mibu Roshi, he was in Kyoto with the Hachioji Sennin Doushin to provide security\\nfor the Shogun and his retainers. While there Matsugoro took part in various activities with\\nmembers of the Shinsengumi. However he returned home soon after the Shogun&#8217;s business was\\nconcluded in the capitol. Inoue was also somehow related to Inoue Rintaro, who became Okita Rintaro and was the\\nbrother-in-law of Okita Soji. This connection seems to be how Okita most likely ended up at the\\nShieikan. Martial Skills - Ryu - Tennen Rishin Ryu Rank - Mokuroku Teacher - Kondo Shusuke and Kondo Isami, Shieikan dojo Along with his father and brothers, Inoue was initiated into the Shieikan by Kondo Shusuke in\\n1847. He was very eager to learn swordsmanship and is said to have become negligent in\\nfarming. There are some who think that he actually did reach the rank of Menkyo Kaiden in\\n1860, but he is generally shown as having the same lower rank as Hijikata. Shinsengumi Years - Inoue was part of the group who formed the Mibu Roshi and was a captain throughout their years\\nin Kyoto. At the group&#8217;s height, he was Captain of the Sixth Unit. At the battle of Toba-Fushimi, Inoue is said to have faithfully followed Hijikata&#8217;s orders. He\\nfought without being daunted by the superior firepower that they faced. In the Senbonmatsu area\\nof Yodo, he was shot in the abdomen and killed. His nephew is said to have buried his head and\\nsword at a nearby temple.

\\r\\n Ito Kashitaro [shinsengumi-no-makoto] \\r\\n Military Advisor Born - 1835 in Chiyoda, Hitachi, Shizuki. Died - November 18, 1867 in Kyoto at age 33. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [December 18, 1867 at age 32.] Names - Imina - Takeaki Childhood Name - Suzuki Okura Alternate Names - Ito Okura, Ito Settsu Ito was born into the Suzuki family. He later took the name of his kenjutsu teacher when he\\nmarried the man&#8217;s daughter and inherited the dojo. Still later he took the name &#8220;Settsu&#8221; at the\\ntime when he departed from the Shinsengumi. Physical Description - He is described as a very handsome man and is said to have been a graceful figure. People would\\nstop to stare when he walked through Gion. Personality Quirks and Traits - Ito was a highly cultured and educated man. He supposedly had a mild character and liked to\\nwear black. Family History - Ito&#8217;s father may have been named Ito Tadaaki. He appears to have made some critical error\\nwhich brought him into conflict with domain officials. To spare his family trouble, he tried to\\nleave them. It appears that his father owed a debt of some sort, which Ito tried to raise the money\\nto repay. However the whole family ended up expelled from the domain and their surname was\\nstripped from them. The family then moved to a village called Sakuramura and stayed with one Sakurai\\nShirouseamon for a time. Later they were allowed to have their family name back, but could not\\nreturn to their home domain. Their father opened a school which taught Chinese classics. Because Ito had already moved away\\nat the time of his death in 1852 at age 48, his younger brother Suzuki Mikisaburo inherited the\\nschool. However Suzuki was only about 16 [15] at the time and the school soon failed. Aside from the younger brother, Ito had two sisters. His elder sister was named Koto and the\\nyounger sister was named Suma. Before the Shinsengumi - After leaving his family, Ito moved to Mito and studied at the dojo of a friend who taught\\nShintou Munen Ryu. He also studied Mito learning and royalism thought while there. It was most\\nlikely at some point during this time that Ito became involved with the notorious Tengu-to. By March of 1864 the Tengu-to were headed for open conflict with the Tokugawa authorities. It\\nwas at this point that Ito followed the advice of an &#8220;old friend&#8221; and gave up support of the group.\\nIt turned out to be a good call. Fighting broke out in July and continued through December, when\\nthe group was finally forced to surrender. By that point Ito was already safely in Kyoto by the\\ninvitation of the Shinsengumi. Martial Skills - Ryu - Shintou Munen Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Ryu - Hokushin Itto Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Ito Seiichiro At some point while he was still with the Tengu-to, Ito moved to Edo and continued his studies\\nat the dojo of Ito Seiichiro in the Fukagawa, Saga area. In 1861 he was the leading student of the\\ndojo. That same year he married his teacher&#8217;s daughter, Ume. After Seiichiro died, he inherited\\nthe dojo and changed his name from &#8220;Suzuki Okura&#8221; to &#8220;Ito Okura&#8221;. Ito was known to be well versed in western studies, a skill which made him very valuable to the\\nShinsengumi. Shinsengumi Years - Ito joined the Shinsengumi on October 15, 1864 [November 14, 1864], when Kondo and Todo\\nvisited Edo. He appears to have served very briefly as a captain, but quickly took over Takeda\\nKanryuusai&#8217;s former role due to his knowledge of western military arts. He maintained this\\nposition until his departure in March of 1867. At the group&#8217;s height, Ito was the Military\\nAdvisor. It was on the occasion of his joining the Shinsengumi that he took the name &#8220;Ito Kashitaro&#8221;.\\nTodo appears to have sent the invitation in September, so he had plenty of time to make his plans\\nbefore they arrived. It seems odd that someone who was a devoted loyalist would join the\\nShinsengumi, which is why many suspect that Ito&#8217;s true reason for becoming a member of the\\ngroup was to subvert them to this cause. Ito must have got along well with Yamanami. Both were educated men and practiced the same\\nryu. It is also said that both of them had loyalist views. Upon Yamanami&#8217;s death, Ito wrote\\nseveral poems in his honor. It should be noted that Yamanami&#8217;s death was not the immediate cause of Ito&#8217;s departure from\\nthe group, as some would suggest. If Yamanami&#8217;s death was indeed forced seppuku, then it most\\ncertainly would have influenced his opinions about the group and how he dealt with some of the\\nother members, but it would be over two more years before he actually broke ties with them. According to rumor, things did not go so smoothly with the other Vice-commander right from\\nthe start. Hijikata is said to have disliked the newcomer. At the very least it is suggested that he\\nbecame suspicious of Ito&#8217;s true motives for being with the group at some point. Eventually Ito seems to have given up influencing the Shinsengumi while Kondo and Hijikata\\nwere still in charge. He asked permission to leave the group as early as September 26,1866, at the\\nhouse of Kondo&#8217;s mistress. Hijikata and Shinohara Tainoshin were also there and the four men\\ngot into a very heated argument, with Kondo and Hijikata refusing to give permission in the end.\\nSoon after Ito found an excuse to go to Kyushu, where he met with Nakaoka Shintaro, Sakamoto\\nRyoma&#8217;s friend, and some of the court nobles exiled during the August 18, 1863 political change.\\nIt was through their aid that Ito was able to secure the imperial orders that would allow him to\\nbreak away from the Shinsengumi on March 20, 1867 [April 24, 1867].. At the time that he left the group to take up his position &#8220;guarding the imperial tomb&#8221; of the\\nrecently deceased Emperor Komei, Ito took the name &#8220;Ito Settsu&#8221;, apparently with imperial\\npermission. For a while he pretended to maintain friendly relations with the Shinsengumi, but\\nsecretly he was already meeting with members of the Satsuma clan. However Kondo and Hijikata\\nwere not fooled. Although the imperial orders kept them from moving against Ito for the\\nmoment, they were patiently watching and waiting for him to make his mistake. Some say they\\nhad the aid of a spy within his ranks, Saito Hajime, to give them their opportunity. Things began to fall apart for Ito around the 10 th of November. He had made plans to assassinate\\nKondo on the 20 th , but then Saito suddenly bailed out on the group. He secretly went back to the\\nShinsengumi and informed them of what Ito was planning. Kondo immediately ordered Ito&#8217;s\\ndeath. During the meantime, Ito may have played a part in the murder of Sakamoto Ryoma and\\nNakaoka Shintaro. Whether he had an actual hand in the killing is debatable, but he certainly\\nplayed some part in framing the Shinsengumi for the crime. Just two days before he &#8220;warned&#8221;\\nSakamoto that the group was after his life. This was obviously a false piece of information since\\nKondo was in close contact with Nagai Naomune and must have been aware that Sakamoto was\\nthe one behind the Tosa proposal that would have allowed the Tokugawa to surrender power to\\nthe Emperor, while retaining their lands and having a say in the new government which would\\nform. Ito also helpfully identified a sword sheath &#8220;found&#8221; at the scene as belonging to Harada\\nSanosuke. It was this &#8220;crime&#8221; for which Kondo was later executed. On November 18, 1867 [December 13, 1867], Kondo invited Ito to the house of his mistress for\\ndinner. Hijikata was also there. Against the advice of his followers, Ito attended. Things seemed\\nto go well, but on his way home he found Shinsengumi members lying in wait for him. Oishi\\nKuwajiro stabbed him in the throat with a spear, mortally wounding him. Ito then fought his way\\nto a near-by temple, where he finished himself by committing seppuku. He was 33 [32] years old. Ito was first buried at Kouen-ji Temple. After the Boshin War, his body was transferred to\\nHigashiyama-kaikouji Temple, along with the remains of those who died with him that night. Love Life - Ito was originally married to the daughter of his kenjutsu teacher, Ito Ume, in 1861. She was\\ncompletely opposed to his going to Kyoto. Soon after his departure, she wrote a letter claiming\\nthat his mother was ill. Ito came home at once, but on finding out she had lied, he immediately\\ndivorced her and returned to Kyoto. He was known to have at least two or three mistresses in Kyoto. One of them bore him a son.

Kyoto. Names - Imina - Nobutada Physical Description - Matsubara had a shaved head and for this reason there are some who think he may have started\\nout as a Buddhist priest. He was known to wrap a white bandanna around his head. Personality Quirks and Traits - He is described as a &#8220;noisy&#8221; person. Family History - He is said to have been the son of an Ono clansman from the Harima area. Nagakura however\\nseems to have thought he was from Osaka. Martial Skills - He was an expert in Sekiguchi Ryu, a style of jujutsu. He was also known for his naginata\\n(Japanese halberd). Shinsengumi Years - Matsubara joined the group sometime in 1863 and was a captain up until around the time of his\\ndeath in 1865. It is said that he was demoted just before he died. At the height of the\\nShinsengumi he was the Captain of the Fourth Unit and a teacher of jujutsu. He seems to be primarily to be remembered for a love affair that he had which seems to have\\nbrought him into conflict with Hijikata. The story goes that one night in the summer of 1865, Matsubara went to Gion and became very\\nintoxicated. On his way back to headquarters he got into a quarrel with a Kii roshi who possibly\\nhad the surname of &#8220;Anzai&#8221;. He ended up killing the man. Later on he began to sober up and started to feel guilty over what had happened. He decided to\\ntake the man&#8217;s body to back to the family. However when he found them, he found that the roshi\\nhad a wife and a sick child. The family appears to have been very poor and their home was in a\\nslum area of Mibu down a back alley. Of course this made him feel even worse and he could not\\nbring himself to tell that what had occurred, so he began to simply take care of them. Eventually\\nhe developed very deep feelings for the widow. Eventually news of this got back to Hijikata, who was not happy about him taking up with a\\n&#8220;married woman&#8221; at all. It also appears that the two of them may not have gotten along very well\\nin general. In any event it created a very strained situation and it may have even caused\\nMatsubara to be demoted. In order to try and set things right, Matsubara attempted to commit\\nseppuku. However he ended up narrowly missing death. There are two versions of what happened next. The more &#8220;romantic&#8221; of the two is that Matsubara\\nand the widow decided to commit suicide together when the seppuku wound suddenly became\\naggravated. The story of their death became famous as the &#8220;Mibu Double-suicide&#8221;. But it would\\nappear that this version of events is just that - a story. The other, and probably true version, of what happened to Matsubara is that he died when the\\nseppuku wound became infected. Such a thing would not have been uncommon at that time. As for why someone would make up a tale about him and the widow dying together, the answer\\nis that such stories were considered to be very romantic at that time.

Shinpachi [shinsengumi-no-makoto] \\r\\n Captain of the Second Unit Born - April 11, 1839 in the kami-yashiki (upper mansion) of the Matsumae clan in Edo [Tokyo]. Died - January 5, 1915 in Otaru, Hokkaido at age 77 [76]. Names - Imina - Noriyuki Childhood Name - Nagakura Eikichi or Nagakura Eiji Alternate Name - Sugimura Yoshie Nagakura&#8217;s father spelt their family name with the kanji for &#8220;naga&#8221; which meant &#8220;long&#8221;, but the\\nsecond captain preferred to spell it with the kanji for &#8220;naga&#8221; which meant &#8220;eternity&#8221;. He assumed the name Sugimura Yoshie in March of 1870 when he traveled to Hokkaido and was\\nadopted by marriage into the Sugimura family. Physical Description - There is nothing specific said about what Nagakura looked like, perhaps because there is a\\npicture that is supposed to be him. There was one small mention that he once received a wound\\nbelow the eye from a sword technique gone bad, but whether or not this left a noticeable scar was\\nnot noted. Personality Quirks and Traits - There is nothing specific said about Nagakura, but some general observations can be made based\\non various incidents in which he was involved. He obviously was something of a hothead, like\\nmost of the young men in the Shinsengumi. He could be extremely intimidating. &#160;He cared a\\ngreat deal about swordsmanship and was proud of his own skills. He also seemed to feel that the\\nShinsengumi were comrades-in-arms and resented it when he felt that Kondo was treating the\\nrest of them like &#8220;vassals&#8221; instead. Family History - Nagakura&#8217;s father was Nagakura Kanji, a middle samurai of the Matsumae clan with a 150 koku\\nstipend. Like his son, he had always lived in Edo and had never seen his home domain. There is\\nsome mention that Nagakura possibly had an older brother, but this is by no means certain. If he\\ndid, then this goes a long way toward explaining why he did not care about inheriting his father&#8217;s\\nposition - as the second son he could not. About his mother nothing is mentioned. Martial Skills - Ryu - Shintou Munen Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Okada Juumatsu Nagakura joined Okada&#8217;s dojo in Honjo, Kamezawa, Edo [Kanda, Sarugaku, Tokyo] at the age\\nof eight and reached Mokuroku by the time he was 18. From very early on he hated losing and\\nwould boast about his skill with the sword. At age 19 he decided to leave his clan and travel around to improve his swordsmanship. He\\nstudied for a while at the Shintou Munen Ryu dojo of Yurimoto Shozo, finally receiving his\\nMenkyo Kaiden at age 22. He next spent time at the dojo of Tsubouchi Shume, where he first met Shimada Kai. The two\\nbecame good friends and this would carry over into the Shinsengumi later on. At some point after\\nthis, Nagakura began to take meals at the Shieikan dojo. He would eventually study there for a\\ntime before the group left for Kyoto. Like Kondo, Nagakura favored the &#8220;Rhubi no Ken&#8221; technique. Shinsengumi Years - Nagakura started out as a captain in the Mibu Roshi and maintained this position up until after\\nthe battle at Kofu. At the Shinsengumi&#8217;s height, he was the Captain of the Second Unit and a\\nteacher of kenjutsu. He is most famous for having several run-ins with Kondo. Shortly after the Ikeda-ya affair, he led\\nin filing a petition against the Commander. They were reconciled by the efforts of Matsudaira\\nKatamori. Following defeat at Kofu, he had a final falling out with Kondo and left the group with\\nHarada. After that he went to see an old friend who was forming a new group called the Seiheitai, which\\nplanned to go to Aizu. Nagakura ended up joining him, but they never made it to Aizu. The\\nimperial army had already closed in and they were cut off from the domain. They found that\\nevery other place they tried to go was in a similar situation, so Nagakura eventually had to give\\nup and return to Edo where he hid with the Matsumae clan. Unfortunately he bumped into Suzuki Mikisaburo, Ito Kashitaro&#8217;s younger brother and a former\\ncaptain in the Shinsengumi, in the Ryougokubashi area of Edo. They merely greeted each other\\nand went their separate ways at that point because Suzuki knew that he would lose if they fought.\\nHowever Nagakura began to repeatedly encounter danger after this and strongly suspected that\\nSuzuki was trying to kill him. For this reason he eventually went to the Matsumae clan domain in\\nHokkaido. Later Years - In Matsumae Nagakura became the adopted son of the Sugimura family through marriage in\\n1870. His father-in-law was the clan doctor. Now Sugimura Yoshie, he succeeded to the head of\\nthe family in May of 1875. When the Meiji government finally forgave its enemies, Nagakura had a monument constructed\\nfor Kondo and Hijikata at Itabashi in May of 1876. Not only did he get older members of the\\nShinsengumi such as Saito to assist him, but he was also able to enlist members who had only\\nbeen a part of the group in Hakodate as well. Matsumoto Ryojun was another who participated in\\nthe construction. At some point he visited Kyoto and Osaka, visiting places associated with the Shinsengumi. He\\nwent back to the Yagi residence in Mibu, then visited with Shimada Kai who was then working\\nas a night watchman at Nishihonganji Temple, the group&#8217;s second headquarters. It was also\\nduring this time that he was reunited with a daughter that he had been forced by the war to leave\\nbehind. In 1882 he accepted a job teaching kendo to prison guards of the Sakhalin jail for life-sentenced\\nprisoners in Kabato, Hokkaido. He resigned this job in 1886. Afterwards, Nagakura lived out his remaining years on Otaru, Hokkaido. He may have even\\ntaught Tennen Rishin Ryu there. Even when he became an old man with a bent back and walking\\nstick, he was still no one to mess around with. Once when he went for a walk with his grandson some yakuza thugs bumped into him. The little\\nboy hollered at the men and this of course made them angry. They attempted to get at the child,\\nwho hid behind his grandfather. When the yakuza warned him to get out of their way, Nagakura\\nsuddenly tossed his stick away and straightened himself up. He glared at the thugs in such a way\\nthat they all became terrified and ran away. He then simply picked up his stick and returned to his\\nwalk as if nothing had happened. One of his quirks as an old man was that he like to go see movies. It is said that he like foreign\\nfilms very much. He once commented that, &#8220;Since I have been alive for a long time, I was able to\\nsee such marvelous civilization. It is a very strange feeling. If Kondo and Hijikata had lived for a\\nlong time and saw a movie, by what kind of face would they have seen it?&#8221; Nagakura seems to have thought about his former comrades quite a bit during his final years.\\nFrom June 11 to March 17 of 1913 he published articles about the Shinsengumi serially in an\\nOtaru newspaper. These articles were later collected together in a book. (In more recent times, a\\njournal that he made has been found. It is considered more accurate than the articles because he\\nwrote it a short time after the events occurred and so details were fresher in his mind.) On January 5, 1915 in Otaru, Hokkaido, at age 77 [76], Nagakura passed away of blood\\npoisoning caused by an infected tooth. Love Life - Nagakura was involved with a woman \\ncalled Kotsune, a geiko (Kyoto term for geisha) of the\\nKameya in Shimabara. She became pregnant, but when it was time for the \\nchild to be born, the\\nShinsengumi were in the midst of the declining political situation that \\nwould lead to Toba-Fushimi and Nagakura was unable to be with her. \\nKotsune gave birth to a daughter, Oiso, but it\\ntook its toll on her and she passed away shortly afterwards on December \\n11, 1867. When word of this came to Nagakura, he was very discouraged by the event. However the\\nsituation the group was in had him very busy and it seems he could not even attend Kotsune&#8217;s\\nburial. He was able to go get his child and take her to Kotsune&#8217;s sister, who lived in the village of\\nFudoson. When he left his daughter there, he thought that it would be the last time he would ever\\nbe able to see her, so he gave the family 50 ryo for the expense of raising her and said his good-byes. Late in the Meiji era, Nagakura was finally able to meet with his daughter again. By then she was\\na popular actress in Kyoto and Osaka named Ogami Kogame.

Hajime [shinsengumi-no-makoto] \\r\\n Captain of the Third Unit Born - 1844 in Edo [Tokyo] Died - September 28, 1915 in Hongo, Bunkyo Ward, Tokyo. Names - Imina - unknown Childhood Name - Yamaguchi Hajime Other Names - Yamaguchi Jiro &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ichinohe Denpachi &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Fujita Goro Kaimyo - none Saito&#8217;s real family name was &#8220;Yamaguchi&#8221;. He took the name &#8220;Saito&#8221; when he fled Edo for\\nkilling a man, but the reason for his choice is not known. It is also unknown why he retained his\\nchildhood name of &#8220;Hajime&#8221;. Tradition has it that he was given that name because he was either\\nborn of the first or second day of the New Year or else during the first month of the New Year in\\n1844. His &#8220;imina&#8221; or &#8220;hidden name&#8221; is unknown. When he returned to the Shinsengumi after having briefly left them to join Ito Kashitaro&#8217;s group\\n(some say as a spy), the terms that Kondo and Ito had made in regards to their proposed split\\nshould have made it impossible for him to regain entry. Saito got around this problem by\\nchanging his name to &#8220;Yamaguchi Jiro&#8221; and gaining entry as a &#8220;new member&#8221;, but with his old\\nrank of captain. He retained this name up until the time Aizu surrendered in September of 1868. Upon surrendering to the imperial army, Saito gave yet another name to obscure his identity.\\nKondo&#8217;s execution had made it painfully clear that the life of anyone who had been very high up\\nin the ranks of the Shinsengumi was in real danger if caught. Saito called himself &#8220;Ichinohe\\nDenpachi&#8221; and continued to go by it until the clan&#8217;s move to the Shimokita peninsula area.. Aizu became the Tonami clan and moved to their new &#8220;home&#8221; in 1870. Saito was allowed to go\\nwith them as he had become a member of the clan. At this time Matsudaira Katamori gifted him\\nwith a new name, &#8220;Fujita Goro&#8221;. For this reason Saito always took great care with his new name\\nand would not allow for it to become associated with any sort of scandal. He used it for the rest\\nof his life. Before his death, Saito&#8217;s family consulted him about what he should be called for his kaimyo.\\nHis reply was, &#8220;I have had many names until now. Therefore other names are not desired\\nanymore.&#8221; And so he was buried without one, something which rarely happens in a Buddhist\\ntemple. Physical Description - Saito is said to have had a red or &#8220;ruddy&#8221; face from heavy drinking. He gave the impression of\\nbeing taller than his real height, which was already quite impressive. Estimates put him at about\\n173cm (5\\'8\"). He had long, tufted eyebrows and very sharp eyes. When it comes to his weight, there seem to be two opposing opinions. Some witness statements\\nsay that he was a &#8220;thin&#8221; man. Others claimed that he &#8220;grew heavy&#8221; in his later life and that he\\nwas &#8220;hefty&#8221; as a youth. Probably the discrepancies are caused by the circumstances in his life at\\nthe particular time each witness was commenting about. As a youth he probably was &#8220;hefty&#8221;, but\\nthe war and then years of hardship might would have caused him to lose a considerable amount\\nof weight, making him appear &#8220;thin&#8221;. Later on in his life of course he began to regain weight and\\nso &#8220;grew heavy&#8221;. The characteristic most Shinsengumi fans are familiar with is the fact that Saito was supposed to\\nbe left-handed. However the sole source of this information is Shimozawa Kan and his work has\\nrecently fallen under the suspicion that much of it was fabricated. Personality Quirks and Traits - Saito was known to be a hard drinker. It is claimed that the gastric ulcer which finally killed him\\nwas caused by his fondness for liquor. For the most part, he was a taciturn sort of person. Only when discussing the Boshin War with\\nTakagi Morinosuke or Yamakawa Hiroshi later in his life did this ever change. At those times he\\nwould speak of the past sadly, angrily, or excitedly. He was also noted to be very dignified, especially in his later years. He would not bare a shoulder\\nor place a towel about his neck even in very hot weather as some men did. He always made sure\\nthat his obi was tied properly and when he walked he was careful not to drag his feet. At rest he\\nalways sat in the formal position, called &#8220;seiza&#8221;, and he would remain very alert so that he could\\nreact instantly to any situations that might occur. After the war, he picked up the rather amusing habit of changing and washing his fundoshi\\n(loincloth) every day. It is said he took great care to slap all of the wrinkles out of it before he\\nwould hang it out to dry. Family History - Saito&#8217;s father was Yamaguchi Yusuke, who was born an ashigaru (foot soldier) of the Akashi\\nclan in the Banshuu, Harima [Hyogo]. The year of his birth and death are both unknown. The\\nsenior Yamaguchi was said to have a very strong will. At the age of 21 he handed over all of the\\nfamily&#8217;s affairs to his younger sister and left for Edo. He served there as a lower samurai for\\nsomeone named &#8220;Suzuki&#8221; (possibly Suzuki Shigesuki) in Kanda, Ogawa, Edo. After saving some\\nmoney he was able to buy &#8220;Gokenin-kabu&#8221;. It appears that he may have settled in the Hongo area\\nand that he was involved in work similar to what Saito would later do for the Shinsengumi.\\n(&#8220;Gokenin&#8221; was a rank of shogun&#8217;s direct vassal. Occasionally poor or childless samurai would\\nsell their rank to those of a lower class.) All that is known about Saito&#8217;s mother is that her name was Masu and that she was the daughter\\nof a farmer from Kawagoe. His oldest sibling was his sister, Yamaguchi Katsu, who was born in 1842. She later married a\\nman named Soma Toshiaki, who had been the chief doctor of the Mito clan. Around 1862\\nhowever he opened his own hospital in Edo [Iida, Tokyo]. Katsu must have wed him around this\\ntime because their eldest daughter, Teru, was born on October 7, 1863. The couple&#8217;s oldest son,\\nToshikazu, was born October 4, 1866 and he later graduated from the Chiba Teacher&#8217;s School.\\nKatsu had two more children, one boy and one girl. At some point after this she changed her\\nname to &#8220;Hisa&#8221;. She died on June1, 1875 and was buried at a temple in Chiba prefecture, which\\nis where her husband was from. He returned there to work in his home village of Tega as a doctor\\none year before his own death in 1879. Saito&#8217;s older brother, Yamaguchi Hiroaki, was born June 1, 1843. He was very good at\\nmathematics and later worked for the Department of the Interior in 1874. He then worked for the\\nTaxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, retiring as a junior official. Next he was a law clerk\\nin the court at Fukushima, finally retiring completely in 1898. He lived in Kanda, Tokyo and his\\nfamily was under the protection of one Suzuki Shigesuke, who was probably the man his father\\nhad worked for. Hiroaki may have been known by the name &#8220;Kimata&#8221; during the years he\\nworked for the government. His daughter, Yukiko, was born in 1869. She became an elementary\\nschool teacher, but died of illness when she was only 25, making the Yamaguchi family line\\nextinct. Saito (who was then going by the name Fujita Goro) married a woman named Shinoda Yaso on\\nAugust 25, 1871 while living in Gonohe with the Tonami clan. (The new name of the Aizu clan,\\nwhich had been exiled to what is now the northeastern area of Aomori prefecture.) The marriage\\ndid not last long, ending in June of 1874 when he moved back to Tokyo without her. The reason\\nfor their split is unclear. His next wife was Takagi Tokio, who he married sometime just after arriving in Tokyo in June of\\n1874. The marriage may have even been planned before he ever left Gonohe. The former daimyo\\nof Aizu, Matsudaira Katamori, served as the higher go-between, with Sagawa Kanbei and\\nYamakawa Okura (later Hiroshi) served as the lower go-betweens. Saito was 31 [30] when he\\nmarried Tokio, who was two years younger than him. Fujita (Takagi) Tokio was born on April 15, 1846. Her original name had been Takagi Sada, but\\nwhen she taught writing to the Aizu princess, Teru, her nickname had been &#8220;Tokio&#8221;. Later on she\\nadopted this as her real name. During the war she helped to defend the castle in Aizu, mostly\\ngiving medical treatment to those who were injured. After the war, when the clan was forced to\\nmove, she became the adopted daughter of Kurasawa Heiemon. After returning to Tokyo and\\nmarrying Saito (Fujita Goro) she worked as a housemaster for the Women&#8217;s Higher Normal\\nSchool (or Joushi Takashi), which was a school for future teachers. As a housemaster Tokio\\nallowed with the school&#8217;s permission for young women to stay in the Fujita home as they\\nattended classes there. In her later years Tokio participated in many efforts to honor those who\\nhad died in the Aizu war. For this reason the family was awarded the plot at the Amida-ji Temple\\nin Aizu where they were buried. Tokio passed away at age 75. The couple&#8217;s eldest son, Fujita Tsutomu, was born on February 15, 1876. He went on to graduate\\nfrom Military school and became a soldier himself. Soon after he finished school he fought in\\nManchuria and seems to have been in Okinawa when the war ended. Around 1917 he was part of\\nthe &#8220;Wakamatsu&#8221; regiment and was on the warship &#8220;Mikawa&#8221; during the War of the Japan Sea.\\nThrough his mother&#8217;s efforts he was married to Nashino Midori. The couple had seven children:\\nMotoko, Minoru, Ritsu, Kyoko, Susumu, Kazuko, and Toru. Tsutomu was building a new home\\nin 1923 when the Great Kanto Earthquake struck and demolished everything. After this he began\\nto store extra supplies for future emergencies. World War II saw his home devastated again.\\nToward the end of his life he lived with his daughter, Kazuko, who was married to a doctor.\\nTsutomu passed away in 1956. Fujita Midori, the wife of Fujita Tsutomu, was born on March 29, 1876. She was the second\\ndaughter of a wealthy merchant family from Sakata. They owned rice and shipping companies.\\nAt the Women&#8217;s Higher Normal School Midori studied science while boarding with the Fujita\\nfamily. Tokio liked her at once and made repeated requests to the girl&#8217;s family for her to marry\\nTsutomu. The two were eventually married after her graduation. Midori was the one who tended\\nto Saito when he was dying. Fujita Tsuyoshi was Saito&#8217;s second son and born on October 14, 1879. He spent many years\\nliving abroad. In 1914 he married Asaba Yukiko (Yuki), who was the granddaughter of former\\nAizu &#8220;karo&#8221; (clan elder) Tanaka Tosa and his mistress. Yuki was born in 1879. Her family ran a\\ndelivery service in Yokusuka. The couple had two sons and two daughters. Their eldest son was\\nHidaki. The younger son and daughter were adopted by the Asaba family. Saito&#8217;s youngest son was born on July 1, 1886. Even before his birth Tokio&#8217;s cousin, Numazawa\\nKohachiro, had already asked to adopt the child. He was named Numazawa Tatsuo and for many\\nyears the truth that he was actually the son of the Fujita family was hidden from him. However he\\neventually became suspicious and when he was in college he asked a relative about his birth.\\nNaturally he was very upset when he found out the truth, but he seems to have maintained\\ncontact with his real parents afterwards. He later married a woman named Tazu and had a\\ndaughter, Eiko. Takagi Family - Takagi Tokio&#8217;s father was Takagi Kojuro. He was a metsuke of Aizu with a fief of 300 koku.\\nHer mother, Katsuko, was originally from the Kimoto family. Tokio had a younger sister named\\nTami, who was born in June of 1847. However she died at the age of two. Tokio also had a younger brother, Takagi Morinosuke. He was born September 15, 1854 and his\\nchildhood name was &#8220;Goro&#8221;. He worked in the public prosecutors&#8217; offices of such places as\\nShizuoka, Hokkaido, and Fukushima as a Chief Public Prosecutor. One of his daughters, Hatako,\\nlater married Sagawa Kanbei&#8217;s son, Naoaki. Saito appears to have taught kendo to Morinosuke&#8217;s\\nsons. Takamine Hideo was a cousin of Tokio&#8217;s and the person responsible for helping them get their\\njobs with the schools. He was something of a scholar and became principal of the Higher Normal\\nSchool in 1879. He became principal of the Women&#8217;s Higher Normal School in 1897 at age 44. Numazawa Kachiro was another cousin and he was married to a woman named Kuni. His\\nmother, Michiko, was the older sister of Tokio&#8217;s mother. The Numazawa was an important Aizu\\nfamily as they had been &#8220;karo&#8221; (clan elders) there before the war. Since Kachiro&#8217;s wife could not\\nhave children, the family was in danger of extinction. For this reason the Fujita family allowed\\nthem to adopt their youngest son, Tatsuo. Before the Shinsengumi - At 19 Saito is thought to have killed a &#8220;Hatamoto&#8221; (a direct retainer of the shogun) at\\nKoishikawa Sekiguchi in Edo. For this reason he was forced to flee to Kyoto and change his\\nname to &#8220;Saito Hajime&#8221;. Before he left, his father gave him a letter addressed to an old friend of\\nhis named Yoshida, who owned a dojo. It appears that Yamaguchi Yusuke may have done this\\nperson some sort of favor in the past and so Yoshida was willing to take Saito in to repay him.\\nWhile there Saito served as an assistant instructor. (It is not known for certain, but this man may\\nhave been one Yoshida Katsumi, who taught Shotoku Taishi Ryu.) This possibly took place\\naround December of 1862, only a couple of months before the rest of the Shieikan members were\\nto travel to Kyoto with the Roshitai. At any rate it seems the matter was quickly forgotten and\\nSaito later had no trouble visiting Edo. Martial Skills - Ryu - Either Mugai Ryu or Itto Ryu Rank - Saito is referred to as a &#8220;master&#8221;. According to the Fujita family, Saito learned Itto Ryu (probably Mitzoguchi Itto Ryu) at the Aizu\\nclan mansion in Edo. This kindness was extended toward him because of a service that his father\\nwas supposed to have preformed. If true, then it shows that he had strong links with the clan long\\nbefore the Shinsengumi came under its service. However it is claimed that there are police records which show his sword style was actually\\nMugai Ryu. The truth of the matter is currently uncertain. In additon, Saito seems to have had\\nsome acquaintance at least with a form of Taishi Ryu (possibly Shotoku Taishi Ryu), since he\\nworked as an assistant instructor of a Taishi dojo for a man named Yoshida after fleeing to\\nKyoto. Even Nagakura seems to have either been unable or unwilling to shed any light on the subject.\\nDuring the Meiji era, he visited the Shieikan dojo and briefly helped Kondo&#8217;s nephew teach. One\\nof the students asked him about Saito&#8217;s sword style and his reply was, &#8220;Since I and Saito-kun\\nseldom talked, I do not know it.&#8221; What truly makes this statement bizarre is that Nagakura\\napparently knew Saito for some time even before they formed the Shinsengumi. While one could\\npossibly believe that they were too busy in Kyoto and perhaps too weary of fighting to discuss\\nswordsmanship, it is hard to think that he would not have at least noticed Saito&#8217;s style while at\\nthe Shieikan. According to both Kojima Shikanosuke and Nagakura, Saito spent at least some time at &#160;Kondo&#8217;s\\nShieikan dojo before they went to Kyoto. Saito also confirmed this when he told the story of how\\nhe bought Kondo a sword which resembled a Kotetsu from a second-hand shop called the\\nYotsuya. It was to thank Kondo for lessons he had received at the Shieikan. Rumor has it that Saito was good with a left-handed thrust. However this is based on the\\nassumption that he was actually left-handed, a theory now under question. As for other skills, it is suggested that Saito&#8217;s jujutsu style was Sekiguchi Ryu. His Sword - Long Sword - Sesshu sumi Ikeda Kijinmaru Kunishige - 2\\'3\"1 The &#8220;Kijinmaru&#8221; element of the sword&#8217;s name means &#8220;demon&#8221;. Kunishige was the swordsmith\\nand the blade was forged sometime in the Tenwa era, which lasted from 1681-1683 or there\\nabouts. Shinsengumi Years - Saito appears to have joined the Mibu Roshi around March 5, 1863. Because of the connection\\nhe supposedly had to the Shieikan, he was made a captain in the group right away and continued\\nin this position at least until Kofu. For a short time after that he actually led the Shinsengumi in\\nthe Shirakawa castle area while Hijikata recovered from an injury he received in a previous\\nbattle. Saito&#8217;s part in the group came to an end when he and others chose to remain in Aizu rather\\nthan go with Hijikata to Sendai. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was Captain of the Third\\nUnit and a teacher of kenjutsu. While the group was in Mibu, he seems to have most often stayed at the house of one Nanbu\\nKamejiro. (The group was fairly spread out around the village at the time.) However he was at\\nthe Yagi house often enough for the youngest son to recall him quite well. Saito was one of the strongest swordsmen in the group, along with Okita and Nagakura. In fact it\\nis rumored that even Okita feared his skill and that Saito was rarely ever wounded despite all of\\nthe dangerous jobs he performed. He is primarily remembered for his role in dealing with &#8220;difficult members&#8221; of the group and yet\\nthere is much debate over whether or not many of those stories have any truth to them. For\\ninstance, he is said to have killed both Takeda Kanryuusai and Tani Sanjuro. However the dates\\nand circumstances of Takeda&#8217;s death seem odd, while Tani was officially said to have died of a\\nstroke and his supposed murder ties into the tale about Saito being left-handed. And Abe Juro\\nnever believed that Saito joined Ito&#8217;s group as a spy for Kondo and Hijikata. For all these\\nreasons, it is difficult to determine exactly how big a role he actually did play in such affairs. Saito remained with the Shinsengumi all the way to Aizu. But when Hijikata decided to go to\\nSendai, he was unwilling to abandon Aizu and so they parted ways. From there he became part of\\nthe clan and shared in their exile to the Shimokita peninsula area in what is now Aomori\\nprefecture. Later Life - Saito left Gonohe in Aomori prefecture on June 10, 1874 and went to Tokyo, where he would\\nlive for the rest of his life. Shortly after his arrival he married Takagi Tokio and the two of them\\nsettled down in the Hongo area, now a part of the Bunkyo Ward. It is unclear exactly when and how Saito became part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police\\nDepartment. There is some evidence that he may have in fact been connected with the police as\\nearly as 1871 or 1872. Another possibility is that he entered the department with help from\\nSagawa Kanbei in 1874. In 1873, Saigo Takamori pulled out of the Meiji government with many\\nof his supporters. Left with a severe shortage in manpower, the police department contacted\\nSagawa and managed to convince him to bring men from the Aizu clan to help. As bitter as they\\nwere over their defeat in the war, poverty made many willing to work for the Meiji government\\nand he was able to round up 300 volunteers. Perhaps Saito was one of them or else when he\\ndecided to go to Tokyo, he contacted Sagawa about a job. The first clear record of Saito&#8217;s being with the police was when he was made an inspector on\\nFebruary 20, 1877 at age 34 [33] and given permission to carry a sword. That same year the\\nSouthwestern Rebellion broke out, so on May 18, 1877 he left for the front. There he served in\\nthe Bongo Police Troop under Chief Inspector Hagiwara Sadamoto. Saito himself had 107 men\\nunder his command in the second small group of this police troop. On July 12, 1877 in the Miyazaki prefecture, Saito&#8217;s men, who had split up from the other half of\\nthe group, followed a main road over the Fukuhara pass and met the enemy at Yakio. They began\\nto push the foe toward Mt. Takayuka, where the other group was already fighting with the rebels.\\nIt was here that Saito was shot. Unfortunately there are no details on how badly, but it forced his\\nmen to withdraw to Yakio for a bit. However they soon rejoined the fight and drove off the\\nenemy, capturing two cannon in the process. Saito returned home on October 28, 1877. It took an entire year, but he was eventually award 100\\nyen and a medal, &#8220;The Order of the Blue Paulownia&#8221;, for his service. He continued to serve with\\nthe police in various ranks and eventually became a Chief Inspector on November 1, 1888, at the\\nage of 45 [44]. He retired from the police force in April of 1891 at the age of 48 [47]. At this time Tokio&#8217;s cousin, Takamine Hideo, helped him to get a job as a guard for the Tokyo\\nEducational Museum, which was associated with the Higher Normal School, which taught\\nstudents who wanted to become teachers. During this time he taught kenjutsu to the school&#8217;s\\nclubs. It is said that his students could not even graze his fingers. Takamine was principal of the school while Saito was there and he had a shed where valuable\\nswords and works of art were kept. It was always kept locked and the only person he allowed to\\nhave free access to the building was Saito. Apparently the former Shinsengumi captain had a\\ngood eye for swords and was able to repair them, so his opinion was often sought. Saito retired from this job in April of 1899 and then became a secretary or clerk at the Women&#8217;s\\nHigher Normal School. (It would become the Tokyo Women&#8217;s Higher Normal School in 1908,\\none year before he retired.) He handled the schools finances and general affairs. On rainy days he\\nwould direct the jinrikisha (rickshaw) traffic which would become very heavy at such times. He\\nretired from this job in 1909. As one might guess, Saito made sure his own sons knew how to use a sword. One of them later\\nrecalled a year they found &#8220;unbearable&#8221; because Saito kept popping out at them unexpectedly to\\ntry to beat them with a shinai. He would always get angry with them because they were\\ninvariably caught off-guard and shout &#8220;Shidou fukakugo!&#8221; (Unprepared for the way of a man!) Saito did not have an easy time of it in the Meiji era. He reportedly told a grandson that many\\npeople had sought his life after the restoration, putting him in much danger. It is known that Saito kept contact with the other former members of the Shinsengumi. He\\ncontributed to the monument that Nagakura had built at Itabashi. He also kept in touch with some\\nof the people in the Tama area. The family of Sato Hikogoro for instance left records of things\\nthat Saito had told them about the Shinsengumi during the Meiji era. He eventually developed a gastric ulcer\\n which led to his death. While he was ill, his daughter-in-law, Midori, \\nwas the one who cared for him. Toward the end she had to remove phlegm \\nfrom his\\nthroat with carefully wrapped chopsticks so he could breath. When the \\nmedicine no longer\\nworked he realized that his time was near and refused to stay in bed. He\\n had his family help him\\nto get up and change into white clothing, then was assisted to the main \\nroom where he sat seiza\\nbefore the tokonoma. (He sat in the formal sitting position before the \\nalcove, which is considered\\nto be a place of honor.) At 1:00 am he is said to have suddenly glared \\nand died. Saito passed\\naway on September 28, 1915 at the age of 72 [71] and was buried at the \\nAmida-ji Temple in\\nAizu, which was now called Fukushima. The manner in which he met his end shows that while the Meiji government could regulate &#8220;the\\nold ways&#8221; out of sight, but they could not regulate them out of people&#8217;s hearts. Love Life - Saito is connected with at least two women before he married Takagi Tokio. The first was while he was with the Shinsengumi in Kyoto. She was known as Aioi Tayu and she\\nwas from the Kikyo-ya in Shimabara. She later became a &#8220;geisya&#8221; in Gion and he was supposed\\nto have visited her often. Abe Juro would recall this years later and said that Saito was &#8220;untidy&#8221;\\nwith women. He never believed that Saito spied on Ito and his followers for Kondo and insisted\\nthat Saito had stolen money from Ito in order to visit this woman, which was the reason for his\\nsudden departure from the group. Others say this was a clever ruse to keep Ito from suspecting\\nwhat he had really been up to. The other affair was a bit more serious, because he actually married the woman. In 1870 the Aizu\\nclan moved north to the Shimokita peninsula area [Aomori prefecture] and became the Tonami\\nclan with permission from the government. Saito, now Fujita Goro, moved with them and was\\nsettled in Gonohe. He lived in the house of Kuraswa Heiemon, who was one of the last advisors\\nof the Aizu clan and was serving as a vice-counselor of the Tonami clan. Saito apparently\\nworked as a clan clerk or secretary at that point. At that time there was a woman named Shinoda Yaso living in the house of Uedo Shichiro. She\\nwas the daughter of an Aizu retainer named Shinoda Naizo and was born in either 1842 or 1840.\\nHer family appear to have had a rough time of it even before the move. Her older brother had\\nbeen killed during the Kinmon no Hen incident and her father later passed away of illness. After\\nthat she lived with her other brothers. At some point she moved from Uedo&#8217;s house to the Kurasawa house where Saito was living.\\nThings begin to get a bit tricky at this point, because Kurasawa had adopted Takagi Tokio when\\nthe clan moved to Tonami! Obviously she was not Fujita-san&#8217;s first choice and he married Yaso\\nthrough Kurasawa&#8217;s help on August 25, 1871. For unknown reasons Saito and Yaso moved back to the house of Uedo Shichiro on February 10,\\n1873. Then on June 10, 1874 he suddenly went back to Tokyo alone. Yaso is said to have &#8220;seen\\nhim off&#8221;. Shortly after he reached Tokyo he was married to Takagi Tokio, so it would appear that\\nhe divorced Yaso for some reason. (There were any number of things that might have been\\nbehind this decision. Yaso might have been sick or unable to have children. Or it could have\\nbeen outside interference from members of the Aizu clan.) The last record of Yaso is that she moved back to the house of Kurasawa on July 20, 1876. It is\\nspeculated that she might have died that year. The Left-handed Killer - The story of Saito being left-handed seems to come from Shimozawa Kan and is tied in with the\\nepisode of Shinsengumi captain Tani Sanjuro&#8217;s sudden death. The supposed story goes that Tani\\nfailed to make a clean cut when he served as a second to a member who had to commit seppuku.\\n(This story appears to be false, because Tani died before the person named committed seppuku.)\\nOne month later, on April 1, 1866, he was found dead at Gion-ishidanshita, the stone stairway\\nthat leads up to the famous Gion Shrine (also called Yasaka shrine). An urgent report came into the Shinsengumi headquarters from patrol soldiers about the\\nincident.. At the time it happened to be raining. Saito and Shinohara Tainoshin had just returned\\nfrom someplace and were already wet, so they were sent out to investigate. As the story goes,\\nTani had received a thrust to his chest that went all the way to his back and had died clinging to\\nthe wall of a small restaurant in a half-sitting position. His sword had never been unsheathed. Shinohara laughed and said that the thrust had come from the left side, so the suspect &#8220;had to be\\nas left-handed&#8221; as Saito. In his turn, Saito asked Shinohara not to please not say that as if it were\\nhim who had done the deed. Both of them laughed and they put the body into a palanquin and\\ntook it back to headquarters. Unfortunately, this is the only description of Saito saying that he was left-handed. Shimozawa\\nsays the source of the story is some sort of journal that Saito kept called the &#8220;Muroku&#8221;, but no\\none else has ever claimed to see such a document and its existence is now a matter of debate.\\nAnd until its is proven one way or another, whether or not Saito was truly a left-handed\\nswordsman will also continue to be a mystery.

Hitachi, Mito clan. Died - September 16, 1863 or September 18, 1863 in Mibu, Kyoto at age 34. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [October 28, 1863 or October 30, 1863 at age 33.] Names - Imina - Mitsumoto Childhood Name - Tatsutoshi Alternate Names - Kimura Tsuguji (Shitamura Tsuguji) Serizawa used the name Kimura Tsuguji (Shitamura Tsuguji) while he was with the Tengu-to. No one knows why he chose the name &#8220;Kamo&#8221; when he joined the Roshitai. It may be tied to a\\nshrine in his hometown. Nagakura noted that most people referred to him as &#8220;sensei&#8221;. Physical Description - Serizawa was a tall, stout person with a pale complexion and narrow eyes. He was considered to\\nbe an impressive character who had a &#8220;distinguished air&#8221; about him. However it is also said that\\nmost days he reeked of liquor. Personality Quirks and Traits - On one hand Serizawa was a well educated person who had studied ancient Japanese history and\\nculture. He was good at poetry and considered a &#8220;clever&#8221; man. On the other, he was generally an\\narrogant individual prone to drunkenness and violence. He was vain of his family&#8217;s social\\nstanding and tended to look down on the other members of the group. He liked to refer to himself\\nas &#8220;Captain Boss&#8221; or &#8220;Head Chief&#8221;. He also exhorted money from the merchants he was\\nsupposed to be protecting from loyalists who had been doing exactly the same thing. He tended\\nto be easily &#8220;insulted&#8221; and many of the incidents he was involved in were the result of some\\nperceived slight to his person. Recently it has been suggested that Serizawa could have suffered from syphilis, an STD that is\\nknown to attack the brain and cause the victim to behave irrationally. However this is only a\\ntheory and there is no real proof of his having such an illness. Serizawa is probably best known for the tessen (iron fan) he always carried with him. This was a\\nheavy item of about 300 monme (2.48 lbs.). It had an inscription on it which read, &#8220;Jinchuu\\nHoukoku no Shi, Serizawa Kamo.&#8221; (The Knight of Loyalty and Patriotism, Serizawa Kamo.)\\nTessen were a popular item with samurai because they were the one item for self-defense that\\nthey could carry with them anywhere, even into the presence of a daimyo. Family History - Serizawa was the third son of Serizawa Sadamoto. He had two older brothers, Okimoto and\\nShigemoto. At least one of these brothers appears to have worked as a Mito clan official in Kyoto\\naround the time the Shinsengumi formed and may have helped them gain the aid of the Aizu\\nclan. It is speculated that the two Mito clan officials who attended his funeral may have in fact\\nbeen his brothers. Serizawa also had an older sister named Take. Unlike the rest of the Shinsengumi, Serizawa came from a powerful family in Mito. There\\nappears to be a rumor that they were somehow related to the famous Heike clan. There was also\\nsupposed to be a &#8220;secret medicine&#8221; in the family with a purpose and legend behind it similar to\\nthe Ishida Sanyaku medicine of the Hijikata family. Some of the earlier Serizawa family had\\napparently been famous as doctors. Before the Shinsengumi - There is some debate over exactly what year Serizawa was born, but it is usually given as 1830. Before joining the Roshitai, Serizawa is thought to have been a member of the Tengu-to and was\\nin charge of about 300 men. This came about because he was supposed to have taught\\nswordsmanship to Takeda Kouunsai, the group&#8217;s leader. Even back then he had a terrible temper. He is said to have beheaded three of his men after they\\nquarreled in their Itako headquarters. Then he went to Kashima Shrine where he complained a\\nshrine drum was too big and ripped it with his fan. The shogunate officials took this opportunity\\nto arrest him and brought him to Edo, where he was interrogated at Ryuunokuchi. He was able to\\nexplain away his actions at the shrine, but was given a death sentence for the three murders.\\nThere is another opinion that Serizawa was jailed in the Mito Akanuma prison for forcibly\\nraising money or causing &#8220;confusion&#8221; to a town official. Fortunately for him, Kiyokawa Hachiro was forming the Roshitai about this time. Word was sent\\nout that those willing to join would be pardoned of their crimes and naturally Serizawa jumped at\\nthe opportunity. He was released from jail in December of 1862 by this amnesty. In the Roshitai he served as the leader of the sixth unit and was one of the 23 directors of the\\ngroup. Martial Skills - Ryu - Shintou Munen Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Teacher - Togazaki Kumataro Serizawa was considered to be a formidable opponent and had been a kenjutsu instructor himself\\nbefore joining the Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi Years - Serizawa was one of the founding members of the Mibu Roshi and one of the group&#8217;s\\ncommanders. He assumed the position of &#8220;big boss&#8221; of the group and continued to behave as\\nsuch until his assassination. The group only officially became the &#8220;Shinsengumi&#8221; after his death,\\nso he was never a part of it during it&#8217;s greatest period of fame. It was primarily Serizawa&#8217;s activities that gained the Shinsengumi the nickname &#8220;Miburo&#8221; or\\n&#8220;Wolves of Mibu&#8221;. It was a shortened version of &#8220;Mibu Roshi&#8221;, but the &#8220;ro&#8221; could also mean\\n&#8220;wolf&#8221;. After numerous incidents, Aizu finally grew tired of his stunts and &#160;Serizawa was assassinated by\\nmembers of Kondo&#8217;s faction on either September 16, 1863 or September 18, 1863 [October 28,\\n1863 or October 30, 1863] at the Yagi estate in Mibu, Kyoto. He is buried at Mibudera. Despite being his bitter enemies, Kondo&#8217;s people built a grave for him at the temple in October\\nof 1864. Although he had caused the Shinsengumi many headaches, they realized that the group\\ncould never have existed at all without the efforts of Serizawa Kamo.

In fact he was such a big man for his time that his appearance made it easy\\nfor people to mistake him for a Sumo wrestler and most found him to be very intimidating.\\nHowever he was also supposed to seem &#8220;ordinary&#8221; enough on the surface that he was able to\\nwork as a spy for the Shinsengumi for a short time. Personality Quirks and Traits - Even though he looks scary, Shimada was really a very kind person. Surprisingly he was unable to drink a drop of liquor. However he had a huge sweet tooth and was\\nknown to like rice cakes stuffed with bean jam. He would eat 20 or 30 of these at a time. In later\\nyears he would make his own bean paste, but always added so much sugar that he was the only\\nperson who could stand to eat it and would finish the entire pot by himself. Family History - Shimada was the second son of an Ogaki feudal clan family named &#8220;Kondo&#8221;. In August of 1841,\\nwhen he was only 14 [13], the Kisogawa (Kiso river) flooded and washed away some &#8220;business\\nmaterials&#8221; which were in his father&#8217;s care. Taking responsibility, his father committed seppuku. Sometime after he had met Nagakura at a dojo in Edo, he was adopted by another Ogaki\\nclansman who was named &#8220;Shimada&#8221;. However it was not long before he left and traveled to\\nKyoto, where he met up with Nagakura and the Shinsengumi. This adoption would have taken\\nplace sometime between 1857 - 1863. While in Kyoto, Shimada fell in love with a woman who was somehow the dependant of a court\\nnoble family named Tanbaya. (She may have been an adopted daughter.) Her name was unclear,\\nbut could have been something along the lines of &#8220;Okaki&#8221;. She was twelve years younger than\\nShimada and only stood 121cm (4\\'0\") tall. She is remembered as a good woman and was\\nsupposed to have been quite beautiful. There is some difference of opinion about when Shimada actually became involved with this\\nperson. Some say he met her before the Shinsengumi, others that it was sometime afterwards. It\\nappears that the date of their marriage was August 15, 1865. The couple had several children. Their eldest son was born in March of 1866. Their second son\\nwas born September 28, 1871, indicating that his family must have been allowed to visit with\\nhim at least while he was a prisoner following the Boshin War. They had a daughter in June of\\n1874 and their third son, Seijiro, was born in August of 1876. Still another son was born in\\nDecember of 1879 and their last child appears to have been born in 1884. Shimada would have\\nbeen 57 [56] by that time. Before the Shinsengumi - After the death of his father, Shimada worked for an Owari clansman, possibly named &#8220;Endo&#8221;,\\naround 1847. About 1857 he showed up in Edo, where he would first met Nagakura. Martial Skills - Spear Ryu - Taneda Ryu Spear Rank - Menkyo Kaiden In 1857, at the age of 30 [29], Shimada entered the dojo of Tsubouchi Shume and met Nagakura\\nShinpachi. The two became good friends at this time. The dojo was at Iida, Edo. Shimada&#8217;s sword style was not listed clearly. He does appear to have obtained full mastership of\\na sword style, but it may have been a different one from what he learned under Tsubouchi. It is\\nalso unclear if his spear ryu was the same as the one practiced by Harada and Tani or if it was a\\nslightly different style. Shinsengumi Years - Shimada joined the Shinsengumi shortly \\nafter its formation in 1863, when he was 36 [35]. At\\nfirst he worked as a spy, but after Ikeda-ya he became a corporal or \\n&#8220;assistant captain&#8221; in\\nNagakura&#8217;s unit. He worked in this position through the rest of their \\ntime in Kyoto and through\\nmuch of the Boshin War. When he followed Hijikata to Hakodate, he served\\n there as the Vice-commander&#8217;s bodyguard for a time. At the height of \\nthe Shinsengumi he was a corporal of the\\nSecond Unit. Since he and Nagakura were already good friends, it was natural that Shimada would be placed in\\nhis unit. It is said that the two of them always acted together. However their friendship was not\\nenough to convince him to part ways with the Shinsengumi in 1868 and he continued to follow\\nHijikata all the way through the Boshin War. One legend has it that Shimada was by Hijikata&#8217;s side when he fell on May 11, 1869, however it\\nis a false story. Shimada was one of the men defending Benten Daiba. After being &#8220;forgiven&#8221; in 1873, he was released in Edo. Later Life - It appears that soon after being released, Shimada made his way back to Kyoto. For a time he\\nmade his living as a sales clerk in a Buddhist altar fittings shop. In 1876 he opened a dojo and\\ntaught swordsmanship, but students decreased around 1886. Shimada could have had a much better life after the war. Enomoto got him an invitation to work\\nfor the Meiji government, but he declined. Shimada simply refused to work for the\\nShinsengumi&#8217;s old enemies or even acknowledge that the Meiji government existed. For this\\nreason he never held more than a menial job in his later years. Such was the devotion of Shimada\\nKai until the end of his life. In his memoirs he wrote that he loved the Shinsengumi from the\\nbottom of his heart. His last job was as a night watchman at the Nishihonganji Temple in Kyoto, where he made a\\nsalary of 9 yen. Of course this was the very temple where the Shinsengumi had its second\\nheadquarters and one can only suspect that this was part of the appeal of the job. Shimada passed away from illness near the temple&#8217;s precints on March 20, 1900 at the age of 73\\n[72]. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n shimada kai bio shinsengumi no makoto hakodate shinsengumi shinsengumi inspector old age 2nd squad toba fushimi friend of nagakura love story Battle of Hakodate edo kyoto boshin war ikedaya \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n '", "title": "Shimada Kai [shinsengumi-no-makoto]", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381077266/shimada-kai-shinsengumi-no-makoto"}, "188381092101": {"html": "b'<div id=\"post-188381092101\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"type\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381092101/suzuki-mikisaburo-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Text</a>\\r\\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!-- .date -->\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"date\">\\r\\n                                October 16, 2019\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        -->\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381092101/suzuki-mikisaburo-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Suzuki Mikisaburo [shinsengumi-no-makoto]</a></h3>\\r\\n                            <p>Captain of the Ninth Unit<br></p><p>Born - July 15, 1837 in the Hitachi area of the Shizuku province.</p><p>Died - July 11, 1919 in Ishioka, Ibaraki at age 83 [82].</p><p>Names -</p><p>Imina - Tadayoshi</p><p>Nickname - Habutae Miki</p><p>Suzuki had another name as a child, but it was not clear.

15, 1837 in the Hitachi area of the Shizuku province. Died - July 11, 1919 in Ishioka, Ibaraki at age 83 [82]. Names - Imina - Tadayoshi Nickname - Habutae Miki Suzuki had another name as a child, but it was not clear. He also changed his name for a short\\nperiod when he was adopted, but again the name was not clear. He finally took the name he had\\nin the Shinsengumi when he was kicked out of that family. He got his nickname &#8220;Habutae Miki&#8221; (Three layer Miki) from an expensive brand of silk he like\\nto wear. Personality Quirks and Traits - Suzuki was known to have a drinking problem. It was said that he never missed an evening drink. He was also a very frivolous character. Not only did he spend much of his time carousing, but he\\nwould not wear anything that was not made of soft habutae silk. Even his fundoshi (loincloth)\\nhad to be made of the fabric. Despite these shortcomings, he is said to have been able to behave magnificently in the case of an\\nemergency. Family History - Suzuki was the younger brother of Ito Kashitaro. It is said that he dearly loved his older brother.\\nOf the family he was the third child and the second son. His father opened a private Chinese classics supplementary school. When he died in 1852 at age\\n48, Suzuki took over because Ito had already moved away. He was only 16 [15] at the time and\\nthis perhaps explains why the school soon failed. Before the Shinsengumi - At some point, Suzuki was briefly adopted. However his drinking habit soon got him kicked out\\nof this family. It was then that he took the name &#8220;Mikisaburo&#8221;. Suzuki then seems to have gone to Edo for a while. Afterwards he taught Chinese classics and\\nfencing in private school in a village in the Hitachitaga area. Martial Skills - While nothing specific is stated about Suzuki&#8217;s sword skills, it is thought that he studied at his\\nbrother&#8217;s dojo for a time. Shinsengumi Years - Suzuki was visiting his brother at the time Ito was invited to join the Shinsengumi. He was\\namong the men who followed him to Kyoto on October 15, 1864. He soon became a captain and\\nremained one until he followed his brother out of the group in March of 1867. At the group&#8217;s\\nheight he was Captain of the Ninth Unit. Suzuki&#8217;s unit never took an active part in events because Suzuki was too busy being absorbed in\\nthe pleasures of Kyoto. When he left with his brother, he became a Vice-commander of the Kodai-ji party. Later he\\nmanaged to escape the Shinsengumi&#8217;s ambush and sought shelter with the Satsuma clan. Suzuki fought at Toba-Fushimi where he once again clashed with the Shinsengumi when he\\nattacked their headquaters in the Fushimi Magistrate&#8217;s office. He was wounded in his left hand\\nduring this encounter. Soon after this battle, he became the Second Captain in the Sekihoutai. Contrary to what is\\nshown in Rurouni Kenshin, the group was not viciously exterminated by the Meiji government.\\nTo be brief, there were several incidents which caused the government to summon the Sekihoutai\\nback to Kyoto. Members like Suzuki who complied with the orders were given a token jail terms\\nthat only lasted a few months. He was released in plenty of time to join the main army and take\\npart in the Aizu war. After the war he bumped into Nagakura, who was then hiding in Tokyo. Though he did not\\ninstigate a quarrel at that time, it is thought that he was behind several attempts on the former\\nsecond captain&#8217;s life before Nagakura finally moved away. Later Life - In 1876 Suzuki got a job as a police inspector. He retired in Sakata in 1884 as a chief constable. Although he despised the Shinsengumi, Suzuki was known to say prayers for Kondo and\\nHijikata. It was considered that the crimes of pupils of Buddha vanished after death and so he\\ncould not slander or hate them. Even so it still says much about his character. After his retirement, Suzuki took up planting bonsai and poultry farming. He died on July 11,\\n1919 at the age of 83 [82].

From the Izumo province, in western Honshu. Died - Uncertain. Either September 28, 1866 or June 22, 1867 in Kyoto. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[Either November 5, 1866 or July 23, 1867.] Names - Imina - Tokuhiro No information is currently available on his original family name. He was adopted by the Takeda\\nfamily while he was studying in Edo [Tokyo]. Personality Quirks and Traits - Takeda is said to have got along well with Kondo, but was generally disliked by the rest of the\\ngroup. Rumor has it that he had a tendency to ingratiate himself with those in power while\\nabusing his authority over others. A famous example of this is the story that he harassed a &#8220;cute&#8221;\\nmember of the group named Magoshi Saburo. This incident is also supposed to show that he was\\nknown for &#8220;danshoku&#8221; (male homosexuality) as well. However there seems to be no real proof of\\neither accusation. In his defense, it can be said that Takeda was an intelligent person. He also attempted to help\\nKondo by trying to smooth things over during the incident where Nagakura and others filed a\\npetition against the Commander. Against him, it can be said that he attempted to abandon the\\nShinsengumi when he realized that they were going to be on the losing side. Before the Shinsengumi - At one point early on, Takeda may have studied medicine. He was known to have studied the doctrines of Wang Yang-ming, called Oyomei thought. This\\nled to him having some rather outspoken views against the shogunate. It got him arrested, but\\nTakeda broke out of prison and fled from the Izumo province to Edo. He continued his studies\\nthere for a while. Martial Skills - Takeda does not appear to have been known for his skill with a sword. He was however a master\\nof the Naganuma Ryu of military strategy. Shinsengumi Years - Takeda joined the group in October of 1863 and was originally the group&#8217;s military advisor.\\nEventually he was pushed out of this position by Ito Kashitaro, who knew western military arts.\\nAt this time he became Captain of the Fifth Unit and was a Teacher of Literature and Culture. He\\nremained in this position until his death. Takeda seems to have wanted to join with Ito&#8217;s group, but was turned away. Later he made the\\ndecision to leave the Shinsengumi alone and join the Satsuma clan. He tried to cover himself by\\ngetting permission to &#8220;go home&#8221;. Unfortunately for him, Kondo and Hijikata were already aware\\nof his true intentions. On the surface they agreed with his request and threw him a farewell party.\\nIn truth they were setting him up to be assassinated. At this point it becomes unclear who actually carried out the order and when. There are two dates\\ngiven for this event. One is September 28, 1866 [November 5, 1866] and the other is June 22,\\n1867 [July 23, 1867]. If it was carried out by the usual suspect, Saito Hajime, then the September\\n28 th date makes far more sense. At that time Saito had not departed the Shinsengumi with Ito and\\nhis followers and Kondo would have been able to freely give him such orders. The issue becomes more confusing if the June 22 nd date is correct. At this time Saito had left the\\nShinsengumi, possibly to spy on Ito for Kondo and Hijikata. The two groups were pretending to\\nmaintain friendly relations with each other and so members from either side were able to attend\\nthe social functions of the other. It is thought that at some point during the party Saito was given\\nthe secret order to kill Takeda. The main problem with this later date is that &#160;Saito is suspected because Shinohara Tainoshin\\nsupposedly witnessed the murder. It seems unlikely that Ito would have trusted Saito after that\\nunless the killing took place before they ever left the Shinsengumi. If it indeed happened\\nafterwards and Saito is the culprit, then there are only a few reasonable explanations as to why\\nIto did not put himself on guard after this incident. One may be the fact that he himself was in\\ncontact with the Satsuma clan. If he feared that Takeda&#8217;s dealings with them might somehow\\njeopardize his own, then perhaps he might have been the one to tip off the Shinsengumi and so\\nwas in on the assassination. Another is that perhaps Saito was able to convince Shinohara that the\\nmurder was something personal between him and Takeda. Or perhaps his reasons for killing the\\nother captain really were personal and not anything connected with the Shinsengumi. Another theory is that the later date is correct, but that Saito was in fact not involved with the\\nmurder at all. In this scenario other members of the group carried out the assassination. Takeda&#8217;s murder occurred at the Zenitori bridge on the Taketa highway. Most versions of the\\nstory have it that Saito and Shinohara were &#8220;seeing him off&#8221; and walked with him to this location\\nafter the party was over. Takeda was probably drunk at that point. Saito came up behind him and\\nstruck him down, then scoffed at the other man&#8217;s &#8220;high sounding words&#8221;. Of course that depends on whether or not Saito was indeed the killer. Most likely Takeda&#8217;s death\\nwill always remain something of a mystery. The Doctrines of Wang Yang-ming - Takeda&#8217;s outspoken views were supposed to be based on these doctrines. So what exactly was\\nWang Yang-ming&#8217;s teachings? Wang Yang-ming was a Ming dynasty philosopher who studied Confucianism. According to\\nhim, one had to have unity of knowledge and action. While scholarship had its uses, he felt that\\neveryone had the innate understanding of good and evil in them and that virtue was shown only\\nwhen a person acted on that knowledge. In other words it was not good enough to simply know\\nthat the government should be reformed. To mean anything, one actually had to act on that\\nknowledge by attempting to make changes. In Japan the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; tones of his work were feared by the shogunate and a ban was\\nplaced on these teachings. In 1837 an Osaka constable named Oshio Heihachiro proved their\\nfears correct when he instigated an abortive coup that was in large part based on the doctrines of\\nWang Yang-ming. Although it only became a large riot and so failed in the end, it terrified the\\nruling elite and inspired other small insurrections. Worse still, his actions inspired many of those\\nwho fought against the shogunate during the Bakumatsu years later. Saigo Takamori himself\\nstudied Wang Yang-ming. Traditionally Takeda has been viewed as a &#8220;coward&#8221; who tried to abandon the Shinsengumi\\nwhen he knew that they were not going to win. But perhaps his knowledge of Wang Yang-ming\\noffers a different viewpoint. Perhaps in his own way Takeda was merely trying to show virtue by\\nacting on his personal beliefs.

From Bitchutakahashi, Bicchu Matsuyama clan. Died - April 1, 1866 at the bottom of the stairs to the Gion Shrine in Kyoto. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [May 15, 1866.] Names - Imina - Tomokuni Family History - He was the eldest son of a Bicchu Matsuyama clansman. His father was an instructor of\\nTyokushin Ryu, a sword style. Tani had two younger brothers, Mantaro and Masatake, who later became Kondo Shuhei when\\nhe was adopted by Kondo Isami. Before the Shinsengumi - Tani was an attendant in his clan in \\n1856, but he made some mistake for which he was forced to\\nleave. He then went to Osaka. His brother, Mantaro, went with him and \\nthey opened a dojo\\nwhere Tani was an instructor. He is supposed to have taught Taneda \\nHouzouin Ryu, a spear-fighting style, to Harada Sanosuke at some point \\nduring this time period. Martial Skills - Sword Ryu - Tyokushin Ryu Spear Ryu - Taneda Houzouin Ryu Spear Ryu Rank - Menkyo Kaiden Although it was not listed for certain, his rank in Tyokushin Ryu was probably also Menkyo\\nKaiden since he was supposed to be an instructor like his father. At any rate, he was said to be a\\nvery good swordsman as well as good with a spear. Shinsengumi Years - Tani joined the Shinsengumi in 1863, along with his two brothers. His former association with\\nHarada Sanosuke may have been what helped him become a captain so quickly. He remained a\\ncaptain of the group until his death in April of 1866. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was the\\nCaptain of the Seventh Unit and Teacher of Spear. On January 8, 1865, he somehow suffered a slight wound to his foot. How Tani died is one of the mysteries of the Shinsengumi. It happened suddenly while he was at\\nthe bottom of the Gion Ishidanshita, the stone stairway leading up to the Gion Shrine (also called\\nYasaka jinja) in Kyoto. The official cause of his death is listed as a stroke. Of course there are stories which say this was a cover-up and that he was really murdered. One\\nsuch version has it that Tani acted &#8220;shamefully&#8221; when acting as a second during the seppuku of\\nTauchi Tomo. Tauchi had been wounded by the lover of\\n his woman. For this reason he was accused of &#8220;non-preparation as a \\nsamurai&#8221; and ordered to kill himself on March 2, 1865. As his second, \\nTani was\\nsupposed to behead him as soon as he had cut himself in order to prevent\\n prolonged suffering.\\nUnfortunately Tani somehow failed to finish Tauchi with his first swing,\\n an unforgivable error.\\nEmbarrassed by his mistake, Tani ended up failing several more times. \\nFinally Saito was no\\nlonger able to bear it and so stepped in to finish the job himself. Due to this event, Tani lost his reputation within the Shinsengumi. Kondo is thought to have\\nordered Saito to execute him one month later. However there is a major problem with the story. Official records prove that the actual date of\\nTauchi Tomo&#8217;s seppuku was January 10, 1867 [February 14, 1867], a full nine months after\\nTani&#8217;s death. It has also been pointed out that Tani was in fact expert enough with a sword that it\\nseems highly unlikely he could have messed up so badly. (Versions of the story which say he\\nfailed as Tauchi&#8217;s second generally try to make it that he was incompetent with a sword.)\\nFurthermore at least one of his brothers stayed with the group for more than a year after his\\ndeath. Another tale has it that Tani and Saito went out drinking together on the night of his death. They\\nbecame intoxicated and Tani made the mistake of claiming he was better with a sword than\\nSaito. Outraged, the third captain killed him. Of course, one then has to wonder why Kondo and\\nHijikata would simply allow Saito to run around randomly knocking off other captains. At the\\nvery least there should have been some evidence of behind-the-scenes punishment, but this is\\napparently not the case. In the end it appears most likely that Tani really did die of natural causes. (Note - See Saito&#8217;s profile for details about the supposed investigation of Tani&#8217;s &#8220;murder&#8221;.)

1844 in Edo [Tokyo]. Died - November 18, 1867 in Kyoto at age 24 [23]. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [December 13, 1867.] Names - Imina - Nobutora Personality Quirks and Traits - Todo may have been a bit &#8220;showy&#8221;. Mention is also made of his &#8220;Edo breeding&#8221;, implying he\\nwould have been an educated, well-mannered person. Physical Description - Todo is said to have been a rather handsome man, but is also described as &#8220;small&#8221;. Family History - It was rumored that Todo was the illegitimate son of the daimyo of the Tsu domain, Todo\\nIzuminokami. His mother may have been the daughter of a flower shop owner in Komagome, but\\nthis is not certain. Supposedly Todo owned a very pricey sword which a mere roshi could not have afforded and\\nwas supposed to have proved his connection to the Tsu daimyo. Martial Skills - Ryu - Hokushin Itto Ryu Rank - Mokuroku Teacher - Chiba Shusaku, Genbukan dojo Todo is said to have been quite good with a sword. He started out at the same dojo as Yamanami.\\nFor this reason is said to have adored the Vice-commander and his loss affected Todo especially\\nhard. At some point Todo is thought to have left Chiba&#8217;s dojo and gone to the one ran by Ito\\nKashitaro, who was also a teacher of Hokushin Itto Ryu. Eventually Todo became a pupil boarding at Kondo&#8217;s Shieikan dojo, probably because of his\\nconnection with Yamanami. Shinsengumi Years - Todo was with the group when the Mibu Roshi first formed and was a captain up until March of\\n1867, when he departed the group with Ito Kashitaro. He would remain one of his followers until\\nhis death the following November. At the height of the Shinsengumi he was Captain of the\\nEighth Unit. Todo was the youngest person in the group&#8217;s leadership hierarchy according to Western\\ncalculations. He would have been considered the same age as Saito according to how ages were\\nfigured during his lifetime. Okita may have also been in this age group or he may have been two\\nyears older. Despite his long and close connection with the members of the Shieikan, Todo decided to leave\\nthe group with Ito Kashitaro. Yamanami&#8217;s death is often thought to have been a factor in his\\ndecision. On the night that Ito was assassinated, Todo joined the men who went to retrieve his\\nbody. The Shinsengumi ambushed them and during the scuffle Todo was killed despite efforts on\\nNagakura&#8217;s part to allow him to escape. He was only 24 [23].

Physical Description - Yamazaki was a tall man with a swarthy complexion. His exact age is unknown, but he was said\\nto have been about two or three years older than Hijikata. Personality Quirks and Traits - He is described as a gentle person who did not speak crisply. He also appears to have been an\\neducated man. Family History - Not much is known about Yamazaki&#8217;s family beyond the fact that his father was a doctor in the\\nOsaka area who practiced &#8220;hari&#8221; (acupuncture) and &#8220;kyu&#8221; (moxibustion). Martial Skills - Ryu - Kadori style of bojutsu Rank - Master It is said that Saito Hajime enjoyed training with Yamazaki very much because of his unique ryu.\\nAlso, Yamazaki used a nagamaki, which could be considered a longer sword or a shorter halberd. Shinsengumi Years - Yamazaki entered the Shinsengumi in 1863 and first worked as a captain. He eventually became\\na spy for the group and remained in this position until his death a Toba-Fushimi. At the\\nShinsengumi&#8217;s height, he was Head of the Intelligence Division. It is said that Yamazaki entered the group because he wanted to become a samurai. He was very\\nuseful to them because he knew the area. He eventually became a very able spy for the group and\\nwas much loved by Kondo. During Matsumoto Ryojun&#8217;s visit to the Shinsengumi&#8217;s headquarters, Yamazaki was selected to\\nreceive first aid training due to his family&#8217;s medical background. Afterwards he would joke, &#8220;I\\nam the doctor of the Shinsengumi.&#8221; He was very seriously wounded in the last moments of Toba-Fushimi and died either in Osaka or\\non board the &#8220;Fujisan Maru&#8221; as the Shinsengumi sailed for Edo.

Surprisingly, everything about the man seems to be something of a mystery. It is\\ncommonly believed that he was from the Mito domain, though that is far from certain. Even his\\nname is questioned. There is some belief that the name &#8220;Niimi&#8221; was an assumed one and that his\\nreal name was &#8220;Iori Tanaka&#8221;.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;His sword style is also in question, but it was most likely Shinto Munen Ryu. There is\\nreason to believe that he was taught by one Okada Sukezamon and that he held a Menkyo Kaiden\\nrank.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Niimi worked very closely with Serizawa at first, but by nature he was a bit of a loner and\\nit appears he may have gradually distanced himself from the &#8220;Chief Boss&#8221;. There is also evidence\\nthat he was reduced to the same rank as Hijikata and Yamanami towards the end.

Sept 7, 1863 [Oct 19, 1863] Niimi started out as one of the three commanders of the Shinsengumi, along with Kondo and Serizawa. Surprisingly, everything about the man seems to be something of a mystery. It is\\ncommonly believed that he was from the Mito domain, though that is far from certain. Even his\\nname is questioned. There is some belief that the name &#8220;Niimi&#8221; was an assumed one and that his\\nreal name was &#8220;Iori Tanaka&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;His sword style is also in question, but it was most likely Shinto Munen Ryu. There is\\nreason to believe that he was taught by one Okada Sukezamon and that he held a Menkyo Kaiden\\nrank. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Niimi worked very closely with Serizawa at first, but by nature he was a bit of a loner and\\nit appears he may have gradually distanced himself from the &#8220;Chief Boss&#8221;. There is also evidence\\nthat he was reduced to the same rank as Hijikata and Yamanami towards the end. He was\\neventually forced to commit seppuku at a shop in Gion called the &#8220;Yamano-o&#8221; for violating\\nrules. He is thought to have been around 28 [27] at the time of his death. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is claimed that there is some evidence to connect Niimi to the Choshu clan.

Kondo Isami adopted him as his heir before the Ikeda-ya Affair, possibly\\nbecause he heard a rumor that the boy was actually the illegitimate child of an important person\\nby the name of &#8220;Itakura&#8221;. Eventually the adoption was broken sometime before they became\\nvassals of the shogunate and his name became Tani Shuhei.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He remained with the group for some time after his older brother&#8217;s death, but escaped\\nwhen they returned to Edo following Toba-Fushimi. He then went back to Osaka and later\\nworked as a prefectural policeman. Eventually he resigned from this job. He is thought to have\\ndied in Kobe around 1901 at age 54 [53].</p><p>[Note - The Tani brothers were from the Bicchu Matsuyama clan. The &#8220;Itakura&#8221; that Kondo\\nIsami believed Shuhei was the son of was probably Itakura Katsukiyo (or someone in his family),\\nwho was mentioned in one source as having been the daimyo of a &#8220;Matsuyama clan&#8221; that fought\\nin Ezo with Hijikata. As far as I know, the Bicchu Matsuyama clan were the only ones fighting\\nthere, but I will have to try to confirm at a later date if Itakura Katsukiyo was the daimyo of this\\nclan or of another

was the youngest of the Tani brothers and also followed Tani\\nSanjuro into the group. Kondo Isami adopted him as his heir before the Ikeda-ya Affair, possibly\\nbecause he heard a rumor that the boy was actually the illegitimate child of an important person\\nby the name of &#8220;Itakura&#8221;. Eventually the adoption was broken sometime before they became\\nvassals of the shogunate and his name became Tani Shuhei. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He remained with the group for some time after his older brother&#8217;s death, but escaped\\nwhen they returned to Edo following Toba-Fushimi. He then went back to Osaka and later\\nworked as a prefectural policeman. Eventually he resigned from this job. He is thought to have\\ndied in Kobe around 1901 at age 54 [53]. [Note - The Tani brothers were from the Bicchu Matsuyama clan. The &#8220;Itakura&#8221; that Kondo\\nIsami believed Shuhei was the son of was probably Itakura Katsukiyo (or someone in his family),\\nwho was mentioned in one source as having been the daimyo of a &#8220;Matsuyama clan&#8221; that fought\\nin Ezo with Hijikata. As far as I know, the Bicchu Matsuyama clan were the only ones fighting\\nthere, but I will have to try to confirm at a later date if Itakura Katsukiyo was the daimyo of this\\nclan or of another &#8220;Matsuyama clan&#8221;.] (Source: sites.google.com ) \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n kondo shuhei bio shinsengumi no makoto tani family brother of tani sanjuro adopted son of kondo old age departed edo osaka shinsengumi kondo family \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n '", "title": "Kondo Shuhei\u00a0[shinsengumi-no-makoto]", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381452471/kondo-shuhei-shinsengumi-no-makoto"}, "188381464646": {"html": "b'<div id=\"post-188381464646\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"type\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381464646/kawai-kisaburo-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Text</a>\\r\\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!-- .date -->\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"date\">\\r\\n                                October 16, 2019\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        -->\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188381464646/kawai-kisaburo-shinsengumi-no-makoto\">Kawai Kisaburo&#160;[shinsengumi-no-makoto]</a></h3>\\r\\n                            <p>1838 - 1866<br></p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He was the eldest son of a wholesale rice dealer from Harima, Takasago.

Unfortunately the couple bumped into Serizawa Kamo\\none day and the &#8220;Chief Boss&#8221; of the Shinsengumi quickly decided he desired the girl for himself.\\nSasaki&#8217;s boss within the group, Saeki Matasaburo, was a man very loyal to Serizawa and began\\nto plot a way to dispose of the youth for him.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Saeki informed Sasaki that Serizawa wanteed the young woman as his own mistress,\\nwhich of course caused the youth to attempt to escape the group with her.

Unfortunately the couple bumped into Serizawa Kamo\\none day and the &#8220;Chief Boss&#8221; of the Shinsengumi quickly decided he desired the girl for himself.\\nSasaki&#8217;s boss within the group, Saeki Matasaburo, was a man very loyal to Serizawa and began\\nto plot a way to dispose of the youth for him. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Saeki informed Sasaki that Serizawa wanteed the young woman as his own mistress,\\nwhich of course caused the youth to attempt to escape the group with her.

However he was not very talented with a sword and so was placed\\nin the accounting division.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sasaki seems to have been an older man and was very concerned that his age would cause\\nhim to be banned out of the severe group. Eventually he escaped and sought shelter with a Shinto\\npriest in Osaka.

He was forced to leave home due to\\na &#8220;woman problem&#8221; and became a freeloader in the house of a carpenter who lived in the Tama\\narea. This person seems to have had connections to the Sato family in Hino and Oishi was able to\\njoin the dojo that Sato Hikogoro had established in his home. Oishi became very good at the\\nquick draw apparently. </p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He joined the Shinsengumi when Kondo returned to Edo to gather recruits. Before long\\nhe had made himself indispensable to the group and was greatly feared by many. His nickname\\nwas &#8220;Executioner&#8221; Kuwajiro. Oishi was in Okita&#8217;s unit and may have been one of his assistant\\ncaptains or &#8220;corporals&#8221; &#160;as they were called. At any rate he appears to have worked very closely\\nwith the equally infamous captain and this made the 1<sup>st</sup> unit notorious for their &#8220;cruelty&#8221;.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Oishi was \\nentrusted with many important assignments, but there was one which would\\ncome back to haunt him - the assassination of Ito Kashitaro. After this \\nevent, he fought at Toba-Fushimi and when the group was reorganized \\nafterwards he was made a spy. He was still with\\nthe group at the battle at Kofu, but was separated from them during the \\nretreat. His whereabouts\\nafterwards were unknown until October of 1870, when he suddenly appealed\\n to Kano Washio - a\\nclose friend of Ito&#8217;s and one of the members of the group that the \\nShinsengumi had tried to wipe\\nout - for sanctuary!</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kano promptly handed Oishi over to the Meiji government. After being interrogated on\\nthe suspicion that he was involved in the murder of Sakamoto Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintaro, he\\nwas executed for this &#8220;crime&#8221;. Like Kondo, he was completely innocent of that particular\\nmurder. Oishi was 33 [32] at the time of his death.</p><p>(Source: <a

This person seems to have had connections to the Sato family in Hino and Oishi was able to\\njoin the dojo that Sato Hikogoro had established in his home. Oishi became very good at the\\nquick draw apparently. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He joined the Shinsengumi when Kondo returned to Edo to gather recruits. Before long\\nhe had made himself indispensable to the group and was greatly feared by many. His nickname\\nwas &#8220;Executioner&#8221; Kuwajiro. Oishi was in Okita&#8217;s unit and may have been one of his assistant\\ncaptains or &#8220;corporals&#8221; &#160;as they were called. At any rate he appears to have worked very closely\\nwith the equally infamous captain and this made the 1 st unit notorious for their &#8220;cruelty&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Oishi was \\nentrusted with many important assignments, but there was one which would\\ncome back to haunt him - the assassination of Ito Kashitaro. After this \\nevent, he fought at Toba-Fushimi and when the group was reorganized \\nafterwards he was made a spy. He was still with\\nthe group at the battle at Kofu, but was separated from them during the \\nretreat. His whereabouts\\nafterwards were unknown until October of 1870, when he suddenly appealed\\n to Kano Washio - a\\nclose friend of Ito&#8217;s and one of the members of the group that the \\nShinsengumi had tried to wipe\\nout - for sanctuary! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kano promptly handed Oishi over to the Meiji government. After being interrogated on\\nthe suspicion that he was involved in the murder of Sakamoto Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintaro, he\\nwas executed for this &#8220;crime&#8221;. Like Kondo, he was completely innocent of that particular\\nmurder. Oishi was 33 [32] at the time of his death.

Like many in the area, he studied Tennen Rishin Ryu. When Kondo\\nand the others decided to go to Kyoto, he planned to go as well. However his family objected.\\nThat should have been the end of the matter, but in the autumn of 1863 he suddenly showed up in\\nMibu and visited Hijikata, asking to be enlisted. He was turned down on the grounds that he was\\nthe eldest son and heir of his family and sent back home.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He did not give up however and later managed to get Hijikata&#8217;s nephew adopted as the\\nfamily&#8217;s heir and the estate was transferred to him. There is a rumor that Matsumoto got involved\\nwith a gambler and was disowned by his parents. At any rate, he was then free to do as he\\npleased.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since he was no longer the family heir, he was able to gain entrance into the Shinsengumi\\nin 1866. He fought at Toba-Fushimi and then at Kofu, where he was wounded. It seems that he\\nwas separated from the group afterwards.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Matsumoto was from the Tama area and was the eldest son of a wealthy farmer who was\\nthe headman of their village. Like many in the area, he studied Tennen Rishin Ryu. When Kondo\\nand the others decided to go to Kyoto, he planned to go as well. However his family objected.\\nThat should have been the end of the matter, but in the autumn of 1863 he suddenly showed up in\\nMibu and visited Hijikata, asking to be enlisted. He was turned down on the grounds that he was\\nthe eldest son and heir of his family and sent back home. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He did not give up however and later managed to get Hijikata&#8217;s nephew adopted as the\\nfamily&#8217;s heir and the estate was transferred to him. There is a rumor that Matsumoto got involved\\nwith a gambler and was disowned by his parents. At any rate, he was then free to do as he\\npleased. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since he was no longer the family heir, he was able to gain entrance into the Shinsengumi\\nin 1866. He fought at Toba-Fushimi and then at Kofu, where he was wounded. It seems that he\\nwas separated from the group afterwards. He then joined up with a shogunate troop that was\\nescaping to Sendai, possibly by telling them he was with the Shinsengumi. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Sendai he visited with Hijikata, but did not follow him to Hakodate. He returned to\\nTama and married Inoue Genzaburo&#8217;s niece. Matsumoto operated a rice store in Nagoya and died\\nin 1918 at the age of 74 [72].

\\r\\n Oct 10, 1828 - June 13, 1911 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shinohara was the eldest son of a farmer from the Takami Village in the Chikugo\\nProvince.

His sword style is said to have been the same as\\nIto&#8217;s. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The assassination of Ii Naosuke in 1860 greatly shocked Shinohara and he joined the\\ncause of &#8220;Sonno-joi&#8221; at that time. He traveled around for a bit, visiting Mito, Osaka, Echigo, and\\nother places. At some point during this time period, he also married his first wife, Hagino, and\\nthey had a son around 1863. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also in 1863, he was hired by the Kanagawa magistrate as a guard for the foreigner&#8217;s\\nsettlement in Yokohama. This brought him into contact with Kano Washio and Hattori Takeo,\\nwho were also apparently working at this job. That same year Kano took him to Edo and\\nintroduced him to Ito Kashitaro. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the others, Shinohara decided to follow Ito into the Shinsengumi when he joined in\\n1864. However he arrived later than the rest of the group, only showing up on May 10, 1865.\\nAfter settling in Kyoto, he called for his wife and child to join him there. (The reason for this\\ndelay is not listed. He may have stayed behind in Edo to look after Ito&#8217;s wife, but this task would\\nhave become unnecessary when Ito divorced her for deceiving him. Or he may have hesitated\\nbecause of something relating to his own family.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shinohara was made a spy for the Shinsengumi and was one of the jujutsu instructors. He\\nis said to have been friendly with Matsubara Chuji, who also taught jujutsu. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After Ito&#8217;s assassination, he joined the Sekihoutai and became involved in the &#8220;False\\nImperial Army&#8221; case, for which he was briefly jailed. In just a matter of a few months he was\\nback in the fighting, this time as a sergeant in the Satsuma clan forces. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As soon as the revolution was over, he changed his name to &#8220;Hata Shigechika&#8221;. The\\ngovernment gave him a job with the Ministry of Justice, but he did not last too long at this one.\\n(There was some indication that this may have been because of an &#8220;anti-government plot&#8221;, but\\nthe information was not very clear.) He next worked for the Ministry of Finance, but resigned in\\n1873 after only a year. From there on he &#8220;meddled&#8221; in various businesses, but never felt any\\nparticular need to be &#8220;successful&#8221;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for his attitude was the fact that he became a convert to Christianity. At some\\npoint he also remarried to a younger woman. (It was not noted whether he divorced his first wife\\nor if she had died.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1911, Shinohara died of an inflammation of the middle ear. He had his sons with him\\nand his passing was calm. He was 84 [82] at the time of his death.

Abe participated in the political change of August 18,\\n1863, but then left the group sometime after Serizawa&#8217;s death. He went to Osaka, where he went\\nby the name &#8220;Takano Juro&#8221;. It cannot be said that he was hiding from the group however,\\nbecause he stayed at the Tani dojo during this time and so was never completely out of contact\\nwith the Shinsengumi.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1866 he helped Tani Mantaro deal with some Tosa ronin for the Shinsengumi. A few\\nmonths later he was persuaded to return to the group after being told about Ito Kashitaro. He\\nserved as a corporal and a teacher of artillery. (There was no mention of exactly when and where\\nhe is supposed to have learned that skill, which may go a long way toward explaining why the\\nShinsengumi never got any better at it.)</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After Ito&#8217;s death, he joined the Sekihoutai with the other faction members. Later he\\nfought in the Oshu region. After the war, he worked for the Bureau of Development and went to\\nEzo, which had then been renamed Hokkaido. There he established the Abe Orchard and\\ncultivated apples.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In his later years, Abe appears to have claimed to have been the one who shot Kondo.\\nThis lead to his friendship with Shinohara being broken off. Abe also seems to have been\\nresponsible for at the murder of at least one former Shinsengumi member after the war. (The\\nmurder of Yasutomi Saisuke.) He died in 1907 at age 64 [63] of an illness.</p><p>(Source: <a

It cannot be said that he was hiding from the group however,\\nbecause he stayed at the Tani dojo during this time and so was never completely out of contact\\nwith the Shinsengumi. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1866 he helped Tani Mantaro deal with some Tosa ronin for the Shinsengumi. A few\\nmonths later he was persuaded to return to the group after being told about Ito Kashitaro. He\\nserved as a corporal and a teacher of artillery. (There was no mention of exactly when and where\\nhe is supposed to have learned that skill, which may go a long way toward explaining why the\\nShinsengumi never got any better at it.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After Ito&#8217;s death, he joined the Sekihoutai with the other faction members. Later he\\nfought in the Oshu region. After the war, he worked for the Bureau of Development and went to\\nEzo, which had then been renamed Hokkaido. There he established the Abe Orchard and\\ncultivated apples. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In his later years, Abe appears to have claimed to have been the one who shot Kondo.\\nThis lead to his friendship with Shinohara being broken off. Abe also seems to have been\\nresponsible for at the murder of at least one former Shinsengumi member after the war. (The\\nmurder of Yasutomi Saisuke.) He died in 1907 at age 64 [63] of an illness.

When he first attempted to join the\\nShinsengumi (either in Kyoto or Osaka) in 1864, he was almost refused on the suspicion that he\\nwas a spy for that clan.

Since Tomiyama was from there originally, he probably played a part in that.\\nHe left the group with Ito&#8217;s faction and was wounded fighting at Toba-Fushimi for the\\nImperialists. This seems to have kept him from joining the Sekihoutai with the other member of\\nthe Kodaiji Party. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In April of 1868, he was ordered to make some sort of search for the new government,\\nduring which he was captured by an enemy faction (apparently from Mito).

At any rate it seems that they were close enough friends that Saito\\nattended Arai&#8217;s funeral.

the Tenpo era Soma was born\\nin. Some list him as having been born in 1835, the same year as Hijikata. Others say it was in\\n1843. He was the son of a Kasama clansman in the Hitachi province. They were natives of\\nHeihachiro Funabashi. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is yet another discrepancy about the year in which he joined the Shinsengumi. One\\nsource has him in the group as early as 1863, serving as Kondo&#8217;s secretary. However, it also\\nmentioned that he was not made a shogun&#8217;s retainer and played no important role while in Kyoto.\\nThis may be why the other source did not list him as being with the group before 1867, when the\\ncollapse of the Tokugawa government would have forced him to take a more active role in the\\ngroup. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soma fought at both Toba-Fushimi and Kofu and was with Kondo at the time of his\\narrest. He was later jailed for a short period when he was caught trying to pass messages to the\\ncommander from Hijikata and the others. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He was released at the end of June and fought in the Kanto region alongside remnants of\\nthe Shogitai and other pro-Tokugawa forces. Eventually he made his way to Sendai, where he\\nrejoined Hijikata and the Shinsengumi. From there he went with the vice-commander to\\nHakodate and served as one of his aides. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Following the surrender, Soma was the only remaining Shinsengumi captain and so was\\ngiven the dubious honor of being declared a political prisoner of equal importance with Enomoto\\nand other Ezo Republic leaders. But where these men were treated with some fair amount of\\ncourtesy, Soma bore the full brunt of the Meiji government&#8217;s wrath simply because he was\\n&#8220;Shinsengumi&#8221; and received the harshest sentence given to anyone involved in the Hakodate war\\n- exile for life. (Although Yasutomi was also Hijikata&#8217;s &#8220;aide&#8221;, he does not seem to have been\\nleading any men of his own at the time. This may have been why he escaped receiving a similar\\nverdict.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1870 he was sent to the island of Nii-jima, located just south of Tokyo. There he taught\\nreading and writing to the islanders. He also married a local woman named Uemura Matsu. In\\nOctober of 1872 he was pardoned and moved with his wife to Kuramae, Tokyo. Enomoto was\\nnow out of jail and serving the new government and offered Soma a job. It was refused. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Later on Soma committed seppuku for unknown reasons.

The family was from the Nishideragata village\\nin the Musashi province.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nakajima is described as having been &#8220;strong&#8221; and had a pale complexion and thin eyes.\\nHe began studying the military arts in early childhood and was taught Tennen Rishin Ryu by\\nYamamoto Manjiro, who had been trained by Kondo Shusuke. Nakajima achieved a Chugokai\\nMokuroku ranking, although there are some who claim he held a much higher rank.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1857 he married a woman named Yasukatsu. This marriage was eventually ended\\nbecause she didn&#8217;t like his later involvement with the Shinsengumi.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nakajima first attempted to join the group in 1864, but was refused formal entrance\\nbecause he was married. Informally, Kondo gave him a job conducting espionage missions in the\\nKanto region for the group. When he divorced in 1867, he was allowed formal entrance into the\\ngroup.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He served as a spy for much of the Boshin War and surrendered with Soma at Benten\\nDaiba. During his subsequent captivity, he painted the portraits of his departed comrades in the\\nShinsengumi. Humorously, one of these paintings was of the very-much-still-alive Saito Hajime.</p><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Released in 1870, he settled in a place called Hamamatsu in Shizuoka, where he\\nremarried and grew a plant called &#8220;haran&#8221; (better known in the Western world as &#8220;aspidistra\\nelatior&#8221; or &#8220;Castiron Plant&#8221;). He also opened a successful gunshop. Nakajima passed away in\\n1887 at the age of 50 [49].</p><p>(Source: <a

Nakajima Yukuchi, a member of the Hachiouji Sennin Doushin\\nwhich was headed by Inoue Genzaburo&#8217;s family. The family was from the Nishideragata village\\nin the Musashi province. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nakajima is described as having been &#8220;strong&#8221; and had a pale complexion and thin eyes.\\nHe began studying the military arts in early childhood and was taught Tennen Rishin Ryu by\\nYamamoto Manjiro, who had been trained by Kondo Shusuke. Nakajima achieved a Chugokai\\nMokuroku ranking, although there are some who claim he held a much higher rank. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1857 he married a woman named Yasukatsu. This marriage was eventually ended\\nbecause she didn&#8217;t like his later involvement with the Shinsengumi. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nakajima first attempted to join the group in 1864, but was refused formal entrance\\nbecause he was married. Informally, Kondo gave him a job conducting espionage missions in the\\nKanto region for the group. When he divorced in 1867, he was allowed formal entrance into the\\ngroup. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He served as a spy for much of the Boshin War and surrendered with Soma at Benten\\nDaiba. During his subsequent captivity, he painted the portraits of his departed comrades in the\\nShinsengumi. Humorously, one of these paintings was of the very-much-still-alive Saito Hajime. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Released in 1870, he settled in a place called Hamamatsu in Shizuoka, where he\\nremarried and grew a plant called &#8220;haran&#8221; (better known in the Western world as &#8220;aspidistra\\nelatior&#8221; or &#8220;Castiron Plant&#8221;). He also opened a successful gunshop. Nakajima passed away in\\n1887 at the age of 50 [49].

the Ogaki clan, Ichimura joined the Shinsengumi in 1867 at the age of 14 [13]\\nand was Hijikata&#8217;s page.

Ichimura flatly refused, saying he would stay and die with the vice-commander and\\nthat he should get someone else to do it. Hijikata reportedly grew furious with him and\\nthreatened to kill the boy himself on the spot if he did not obey orders. The vice-commander\\nresorted to this scare tactic because he felt Ichimura was far too young to die and wanted him out\\nof harm&#8217;s way. It worked. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Reportedly, Ichimura said that when he looked back while making his escape from\\nGoryokaku, he could see that someone was watching him from the gate. He believed this person\\nto be Hijikata. It is said that he was able to slip past the imperial army by disguising himself as a\\nbeggar. Eventually he was able to board a ship headed for Yokohama and it was while onboard\\nthat he heard Hijikata had been killed in the battle. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Three months after escaping Goryokaku, Ichimura showed up at the Sato house in Hino\\nwith the mementoes. It appears that he may have been the one who broke the news about\\nHijikata&#8217;s death to them. They took him in and sheltered him for a while, during which time he\\nstudied swordsmanship. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In March of 1871 he left and returned to his hometown. It becomes unclear what\\nhappened to him afterwards. One rumor says that he died of an illness at age twenty. There is\\nanother opinion however that he joined Saigo Takamori&#8217;s failed rebellion in 1877. He is\\nsupposed to have been killed in the fighting in a place called Tabaruzaka. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ichimura&#8217;s older brother, Tatsunosuke, had also joined the Shinsengumi in 1867. He\\nescaped the group either just before or just after Kondo&#8217;s arrest. Returning home, he became a\\nmerchant and died of an illness in 1872. He had children before his death and recently some of\\nhis descendants have been located.

In 1858, he lived as a &#8220;ronin&#8221; (masterless samurai) due to his father&#8217;s forfeit of his &#8220;hanseki&#8221; (registration for the domain), and in 1867 when the group recruited its members, he joined the group with his younger brother, Tetsunosuke.</p><p>In March 1868, he escaped from Shinsengumi after swarming around Goheishinden district (present Ayase, Adachi Ward, Tokyo). Later on, he returned to Ogaki Domain.

He was an older brother of Tetsunosuke ICHIMURA who was a pageboy of the vice chief of Shinsengumi, Toshizo HIJIKATA. His registered name was &#37600;&#20043;&#21161; [Tatsunosuke by using &#37600; (tatsu) instead of &#36784;(tatsu)]. He was born in 1846, as a second son of a feudal retainer of Ogaki Domain, Hanemon ICHIMURA. In 1858, he lived as a &#8220;ronin&#8221; (masterless samurai) due to his father&#8217;s forfeit of his &#8220;hanseki&#8221; (registration for the domain), and in 1867 when the group recruited its members, he joined the group with his younger brother, Tetsunosuke. In March 1868, he escaped from Shinsengumi after swarming around Goheishinden district (present Ayase, Adachi Ward, Tokyo). Later on, he returned to Ogaki Domain. After the birth of his first son, Hisayoshi, he transferred his family estate to him. He died of illness in 1872, and his grave is at Zensho-ji Temple in Funamachi, Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture.

\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Keinosuke MIURA (&#19977;&#28006;&#21843;&#20043;&#21161;) [wiki-corpus] \\r\\n Keinosuke MIURA (1848 - February 26, 1877) was a Japanese samurai and a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was a child of Shozan SAKUMA, an scholar of Western studies in the end of Edo period, and his concubine Ocho, and his real name was Kakujiro SAKUMA. &#8216;Miura&#8217; was the family name of his mother-in-law Jun (younger sister of Kaishu KATSU). Although he entered into Kyoto attending his father Shozan in 1864, the father was assassinated on August 12 of the same year. At this time, he joined Shinsengumi because his father&#8217;s disciple Kakuma YAMAMOTO suggested revenge. After joining Shinsengumi, he became a close retainer of Isami KONOD, Head of Shinsengumi, and was treated more respectfully than other ordinary members, but the arrogance that he inherited from his father gradually showed up and he started behaving rudely with Noboru ASHIYA etc. (therefore, Toshizo HIJIKATA and Soji OKITA always kept an eye on him). Then, he ran away with Ashiya around 1866 - 1867 (Hijikata recommended him to return to Matsushiro domain, but Miura himself refused it). After the Meiji restoration, he changed his first name to Isoshi and entered Ministry of Justice utilizing the fact that he was \\'the son of Shozan,&#8217; but he had a fight against police officers and was dismissed.

a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). During the heyday of his time, he served as a grand master of Gekken martial art, and later he was assigned to a corporal. It is said that he was from Edo and he was an expert of swordplay in Ittoryu style. Some documents describes his name was Kotaro. Shinsengumi He joined Shinsengumi responding to recruitment of members in Edo in November, 1864. According to the record of march in December of the year, he belonged to the group number 5 led by Shuntaro OGATA. He became a grand master of Gekken in the organization in summer of the following year (1865). He fought in the Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident in October 1866. He is thought to have belonged to the group of Kuwajiro OISHI and received 1000 hiki as incentive award money. In promotion to Shogun&#8217;s retainer in July 1867, he was assigned the Mimawarigumi Oyatoi rank. He remained to be a member after that, and plunged into the Boshin War that had broken out in the following year 1868, to be killed on the field.. He died at 26. Three times of death on the field There are various theories about Ikeda&#8217;s death. He fought in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that had broken out on January 27, 1868. \\n It is said that he was killed on the field on 29th, but according to the name list of war deaths in the Eastern Camp, he &#8216;was killed in Fushimi on January 27.&#8217; \\nAccording to Jingoro YOKOKURA, however, he survived the battle and returned to Edo, but was injured while he was fighting in the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma on March 29 of the year and died in Itado, Koshu. It is certain that he was killed on the field, but the place of his death is unknown.

He was a member of binan goninshu (five men of beauty). He is said to have joined Shinsengumi in the early days of the group because he was ordered by Kogoro KATSURA from Choshu Domain to act as a spy in the group. He looked young and had a fair-complexioned, full-cheeked face with bright, clear eyes. He is said to have had such a gentle voice as a woman. He called himself a ronin (masterless samurai) of 17 years in Kyoto. Around 10 o\\'clock in the very foggy morning of October 26, 1864, he stood around in front of the gate of Maekawa residence, which was used as a place where Shinsengumi quartered.

Later he became a member of the drawn sword squad (Shinsen Ryodan [soldiers who are recruited by the government in order to suppress Saigo&#8217;s army]) of Keishi-cho (Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department). Daijiro (&#20195;&#20108;&#37070;) was also written as &#20195;&#27425;&#37070; or &#20195;&#27835;&#37070;. At the time of Boshin Civil War, Daijiro crossed into Ezo chi (inhabited area of Ainu, the current Hokkaido) protecting Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA, his lord, together with Tsunekichi MORI, a feudal retainer of the same domain, and others, entered the Shinsengumi under the command of Toshizo HIJIKATA, and joined Hakodate War. Moreover, any one had to become a member of the Shinsengumi to make a voyage into Ezo chi. After losing the war, Daijiro took a post at Keishi-cho and served to the Meiji Government. At the time of Seinan War, he fought hard belonging to the unit of Keishi-Kyoku (former Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department) with Goro FUJITA (Hajime SAITO) and others. Later he was appointed to a patrol officer of Owase Police Station, Mie Prefecture, and assumed the role of a security guard of a trading company and others even after the retirement. It is said that he wore Jinbaori (sleeveless campaign jacket worn over armor) embroidered a Dokuro (skull) on the back. Daijiro liked to drink alcohol and often talked about the Hakodate War when he got drunk. It is said that he always talked with feeling in the end, &#8220;Toshizo HIJIKATA was really a nice guy.&#8221; Daijiro died at his home in Kuwana City in 1909. He was seventy-one years old. His graveyard is Zensai-ji Temple in Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture.

He called himself as another name, Genjiro. He learned martial art in the Jikishikage ryu school. After he left the Kuwana Domain where he had served as Oumamawari (horse guard) on July 15, 1867, he learned swordplay in Edo. During the Boshin War that broke out in January 1868, Jingoro joined the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate headed by Keisuke OTORI and took part in the battles in Imaichi City and the Aizu Domain. In Kashiwazaki City, he belonged to the Chijin-tai (resistance group composed of the Kuwana Domain&#8217;s retainers) led by Hidehachi MATSUURA and when they were forced to fight from the besieged castle in the Aizu War, he left there to escort Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Kuwana domain to the Sendai Domain, with Shirobe TANIGUCHI who was also a feudal retainer of the Kuwana Domain. In the Sendai Domain, ISHII joined Takeaki ENOMOTO&#8217;s fleet and decided to sail to Ezo. Then he became a member of the Shinsengumi then-headed by Toshizo HIJIKATA. Although he was once successful as a commander of a Shinsengumi squad, he surrendered in Benten Daiba on June 24, 1869. After suspendeded for a while, he was released to go back to his hometown on December 25, 1869. He died in 1903. He died at the age of 58.

His posthumous name was Shigeyuki. He was from the Nagoya Domain. Takaaki KATO, a nephew of his (a child of his younger sister&#8217;s), later became a prime minister of Japan.<br></p><p>Shimenosuke was born as a legitimate child of Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo Province), Ienori TERANISHI, who was a Shinto priest in Sunari Village, Ama County, Owari Province (currently Aichi Prefecture). His previous name was Kuranojo TERANISHI. After his father died at the age of 55 in 1850, he, who aspired to the thought of Sonno Joi (antiforeigner faction), changed his name to Shimenosuke SANO and left for Edo. Given no chance to participate in the Sonno Joi movement, he took on a role of guarding the residential area for foreigners in Yokohama City around 1863 and then became acquainted with Kashitaro ITO and Tainoshin SHINOHARA. He became a member of the Shinsengumi in November 1864 to belong to Yonbangumi group (fourth group). After the goryo-eji members such as ITO walked out of the Shinsengumi in April 1867, he remained in the Shinsengumi on a secret mission from the seceders. When promotion of the Shinsengumi members to Shogun&#8217;s retainers was decided on July 11, 1867, SANO, together with Tsukasa IBARAKI, Juro Tomikawa and Goro NAKAMURA, protested it and tried to depart from the Shinsengumi to join the goryo-eji group, but the rule agreed upon between theShinsengumi and the goryo-eji group did not allow them to do so.

His posthumous name was Shigeyuki. He was from the Nagoya Domain. Takaaki KATO, a nephew of his (a child of his younger sister&#8217;s), later became a prime minister of Japan. Shimenosuke was born as a legitimate child of Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo Province), Ienori TERANISHI, who was a Shinto priest in Sunari Village, Ama County, Owari Province (currently Aichi Prefecture). His previous name was Kuranojo TERANISHI. After his father died at the age of 55 in 1850, he, who aspired to the thought of Sonno Joi (antiforeigner faction), changed his name to Shimenosuke SANO and left for Edo. Given no chance to participate in the Sonno Joi movement, he took on a role of guarding the residential area for foreigners in Yokohama City around 1863 and then became acquainted with Kashitaro ITO and Tainoshin SHINOHARA. He became a member of the Shinsengumi in November 1864 to belong to Yonbangumi group (fourth group). After the goryo-eji members such as ITO walked out of the Shinsengumi in April 1867, he remained in the Shinsengumi on a secret mission from the seceders. When promotion of the Shinsengumi members to Shogun&#8217;s retainers was decided on July 11, 1867, SANO, together with Tsukasa IBARAKI, Juro Tomikawa and Goro NAKAMURA, protested it and tried to depart from the Shinsengumi to join the goryo-eji group, but the rule agreed upon between theShinsengumi and the goryo-eji group did not allow them to do so. Consequently, SANO killed himself by disembowelment, together with the others, inside of the residence of the Aizu Domain in Kyoto City (It is also said that they were barbarously murdered by Kuwajiro OISHI and other members of the Shinsengumi). It is said that at the moment when OISHI came to confirm death of SANO, SANO was revived to slash at OISHI (In the theory that he was barbarously killed by OISHI, it is said that SANO, at the moment when his belly was pierced with a spear by OISHI, rallied his last bit of strength and drew his sword to slash at OISHI and injured him). The theory is considered as a dressed-up version of what is described in an old document. SANO, fully prepared for death, secretly carried his death poem with him. His death poem is &#8220;I, as samurai, was determined not to live a double-hearted life but to dedicate my life toward my only destination.&#8221; In a collection of death poems published in 1868 was found another death poem of SANO having a meaning different from the above poem. His body, which had once been buried in Koen-ji Temple by the Shinsengumi, was reburied in Kaiko-ji Temple by Mikisaburo SUZUKI and others.

In the records about troops of the Shinsengumi, his name is listed between Sanosuke HARADA and Susumu YAMAZAKI. He escaped from the Shinsengumi around August 1865.

Duties of the accounting division of the Shinsengumi included burial of dead bodies, which terrified SAKAI into escaping. SAKAI is said to have been put to the sword of Soji OKITA and other members. He is said to have been killed after escaping. His name is included among the names inscribed on the tombstone for the members of the Shinsengumi in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo.

He was a former feudal retainer of the Saijo Domain in Iyo Province (Saijo town, Nii County).<br></p><p>The alternative spelling of his first name is &#8216;&#35998;&#19977;&#8217; (instead of &#35998;&#36896;).<br>It is possible that the pronunciation of his surname may be \\'RINDO.&#8217;<br></p><p>He joined the Shinsengumi through the membership recruitment notice that was distributed in the Keihan area by December 1864. In the ensuing appointment, he as well as Susumu YAMAZAKI and Kisaburo KAWAI joined the rear-echelon support troop led by Sanosuke HARADA. In &#8220;the Eimeiroku&#8221; (a list of name of Shinsengumi members), which was compiled by Sakigake SHIMADA around August 1865, the name of Teizo name is flanked by those of Shiro KUSAKABE and Shigezo YAGANE.

He was a former feudal retainer of the Saijo Domain in Iyo Province (Saijo town, Nii County). The alternative spelling of his first name is &#8216;&#35998;&#19977;&#8217; (instead of &#35998;&#36896;). It is possible that the pronunciation of his surname may be \\'RINDO.&#8217; He joined the Shinsengumi through the membership recruitment notice that was distributed in the Keihan area by December 1864. In the ensuing appointment, he as well as Susumu YAMAZAKI and Kisaburo KAWAI joined the rear-echelon support troop led by Sanosuke HARADA. In &#8220;the Eimeiroku&#8221; (a list of name of Shinsengumi members), which was compiled by Sakigake SHIMADA around August 1865, the name of Teizo name is flanked by those of Shiro KUSAKABE and Shigezo YAGANE. It seems that he quitted the Shinsengumi soon after the compilation of this list; it is confirmed that he left the special police by October 1865. In fact, when Harumichi YANO (a scholar), who had been captured by Kanryusai TAKEDA (a member of Shinsengumi) in July 4, 1865, was released on July 8 and put under house arrest in Kyukogo, his boarding house, WADO visited Kanryusai to keep tabs on him.

In addition, since there is a description of him as &#8216;misbehaved, but level-headed,&#8217; he may have been witty due to his Edo upbringing. As for his appearance, there is a record of a rumor that he was a short and handsome man. </p><p></p><p class=\"read_more_container\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188382732531/heisuke-todo-%E8%97%A4%E5%A0%82%E5%B9%B3%E5%8A%A9-wiki-corpus\" class=\"read_more\">Keep reading</a></p><p>(Source: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fshinsengumi-archives.github.io%2Fjapanese-wiki-corpus%2Fperson%2FHeisuke%2520TODO.html&amp;t=ZjU0ZWY4NDhmOWFjOWMyNDhhNTYxNGFkOGFlZDczMGRjZWY0ZDMxMSwxODgzODI3MzI1MzE%3D&amp;b=t%3Ab_lEeA4CEUm8Yni1ZQxcqw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fshinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F188382732531%2Fheisuke-todo-%25E8%2597%25A4%25E5%25A0%2582%25E5%25B9%25B3%25E5%258A%25A9-wiki-corpus&amp;m=1\" title=\"shinsengumi-archives.github.io\">shinsengumi-archives.github.io</a>)</p>\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <div class=\"tags\">\\r\\n                                <p><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/tagged/todo-heisuke/chrono\" class=\"single-tag\">todo heisuke</a> <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/tagged/bio/chrono\" class=\"single-tag\">bio</a> <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/tagged/wiki-corpus/chrono\" class=\"single-tag\">wiki corpus</a> </p>\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div> <!--post-text-->\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n                            <div class=\"comments\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188382732531/heisuke-todo-%E8%97%A4%E5%A0%82%E5%B9%B3%E5%8A%A9-wiki-corpus#disqus_thread\">0 comments</a>\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"engage\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div style=\"display:inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/reblog/188382732531/7PKP8G79\" class=\"reblog_button\" style=\"display: block;width:20px;height:20px;\"><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" viewbox=\"0 0 21 21\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" fill=\"#000\"><path d=\"M5.01092527,5.99908429 L16.0088498,5.99908429 L16.136,9.508 L20.836,4.752 L16.136,0.083 L16.1360004,3.01110845 L2.09985349,3.01110845 C1.50585349,3.01110845 0.979248041,3.44726568 0.979248041,4.45007306 L0.979248041,10.9999998 L3.98376463,8.30993634 L3.98376463,6.89801007 C3.98376463,6.20867902 4.71892527,5.99908429 5.01092527,5.99908429 Z\"></path><path d=\"M17.1420002,13.2800293 C17.1420002,13.5720293 17.022957,14.0490723 16.730957,14.0490723 L4.92919922,14.0490723 L4.92919922,11 L0.5,15.806 L4.92919922,20.5103758 L5.00469971,16.9990234 L18.9700928,16.9990234 C19.5640928,16.9990234 19.9453125,16.4010001 19.9453125,15.8060001 L19.9453125,9.5324707 L17.142,12.203\"></path></svg></a></div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div style=\"display:inline-block;\"><div class=\"like_button\" data-post-id=\"188382732531\" data-blog-name=\"shinsengumi-archives\" id=\"like_button_188382732531\"><iframe id=\"like_iframe_188382732531\" src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/assets/html/like_iframe.html?_v=66c22ab5319d742bca5762b8d18f9d06#name=shinsengumi-archives&amp;post_id=188382732531&amp;color=black&amp;rk=7PKP8G79\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"like_toggle\" allowtransparency=\"true\" name=\"like_iframe_188382732531\"></iframe></div></div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div> <!-- engage -->\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n                    \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- post-content -->\\r\\n                    </div>'", "tags": ["todo heisuke", "bio", "wiki corpus"], "text": "b' \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Heisuke TODO (&#34276;&#22530;&#24179;&#21161;)&#160;[wiki-corpus] \\r\\n Heisuke TODO (1844 - December 13, 1867) was a captain of the 8th troop of the Shinsengumi (special police). \\n He later joined the breakaway Goryoeji (also known as the Kodaiji Party.) He seems to have been a single-minded youth who supported the sonno-joi (literally &#8220;Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians&#8221;) movement. According to Mikisaburo SUZUKI, his comrade in the Goryoeji, Todo was of a typical Edo-ite and a motivated worker and there are several records showing that he was familiar with economics and had also mastered kenjutsu (he excelled in both academics and martial arts). In addition, since there is a description of him as &#8216;misbehaved, but level-headed,&#8217; he may have been witty due to his Edo upbringing. As for his appearance, there is a record of a rumor that he was a short and handsome man. Was he an illegitimate child of the Todo, Izumi no kami (military governor of Izumi)? He was from Edo, Musashi Province. His formal name was Yoshitora. In Shinpachi NAGAKURA&#8217;s &#8220;Doshi Renmeiki&#8221; (nominal list of the Shinsengumi) and in the &#8220;Fubungaki&#8221; (report of rumor), which was written when he was in Kyoto, Heisuke TODO is described as an illegitimate child of Takayuki TODO, the lord of Tsu Domain, Ise Province, but the truth is unknown. It is also said that he was a son of Yakura TODO, a karo (high-ranking samurai) of Isehisai Domain, which was a branch of Tsu Domain, and that his alias \\'Heisuke&#8217; derived from the name of a Todo family vassal. One reason for this theory is that Todo&#8217;s long-handled sword (naginata) was inscribed with the signature of the Todo family&#8217;s in-house swordsmith, Kazusa no suke Kaneshige (according to &#8220;Aizu-hancho Shinsengumi goikko katana kai hikae&#8221;). Todo&#8217;s sword was apparently high quality. But it is said to have been ruined in the fierce fighting of the Ikedaya Incident. However, given that a sword made by Kazusa no suke Kaneshige would have been expensive and not one which a mere ronin (masterless samurai) could have possessed, it is highly possible that he was an illegitimate child of the lord. He is said to have been a certified practitioner of the Hokushin Itto school sword style. It is generally believed that he was a student at Chiba SHUSAKU&#8217;s dojo, the Genbukan, but later his comrade in the Goryoeji, Washio KANO, said that he was a \\'favored disciple of the Ito-dojo&#8217; operated by Kashitaro ITO in Fukagawa. However, the details are unknown since there are no detailed historical documents about the Ito-dojo. In any event, he dropped out of the dojo for unknown reasons before being granted a license. Sakigake Sensei As a so-called natural-born soldier from Isami KONDO&#8217;s dojo, the Shieikan, he was a member of the Shinsengumi from its inception. He was a short, handsome and valiant man. He was a skilled swordsman, becoming known,along with Soji OKITA and Shinpachi NAGAKURA, as \\'Kondo&#8217;s Four Kings&#8217; and is said to have walked at the front during patrols. This appears to be the reason for his nickname, Sakigake (literally one who charges ahead) Sensei. Although he was good-mannered, his behavior was inappropriate. When he was in the Goryoeji, he assumed the leadership of 300 vigilantes. He seems to have been warned about his behavior by Kondo since he was a student at the Shieikan, and there is a description that Kondo gradually kept the ill-behaved Todo at a distance. There are no historical documents showing any remarkable activity while he was in the Shinsengumi. Todo may have attended to visitors or done clerical work in the office because he seems to have learned etiquette at the Hokushin Itto school dojo, where relationships between superiors and inferiors were strict. During the Ikedaya Incident, he was slashed in the forehead when he carelessly removed his hachigane (helmet). Until then, he had been fighting so bravely that his sword was ruined, the junction of its blade with the guard being irreparably cracked. After the incident, and following Isami KONDO and Toshizo HIJIKATA, he was given reward money by the Shogunate (he is said to have hesitated to receive the money). In November 1864, the Shinsengumi recruited new members in Edo on a large scale. Prior to that, Todo had gone to Edo to solicit candidates. Kano, who frequented the Ito-dojo at that time, said that Todo came to invite new members in early September. He seems to have associated with the master of this dojo, Taizo ITO (later Kashitaro ITO), for some time. Goryoeji When was the turning point in Todo&#8217;s life? In February, 1865. Socho (general commander) Keisuke YAMANAMI, who had been in the Shinsengumi with Todo since its founding and who was a fellow disciple of Hojushin Itto school, deserted and committed seppuku. \\n (Some people question whether Yamanami really deserted.) It is not known how this affected his life but, in March 1867, he left the Shinsengumi together with Kashitaro ITO in order to form the Goryoeji (Kodai-ji-to). There are no explicit documents regarding his actions in 1866, but on the day of leaving the Shinsengumi, he seems to have been in Mino Province on business. It would appear that he met Yataro MIZUNO, a kyokaku in Mino, in order to lay the groundwork for the future since Mizuno was committed to support him by providing militia for the Goryoeji later. The Goryoeji seem to have joined up with other followers immediately after returning from Mino. Also, no records about his activities in the Goryoeji exist. However, judging from the fact that Todo changed his name to \\'Yashichiro NANBU (sometimes he identified himself as Yahachiro),&#8217; he may have been hiding because he was worried about the bad influence, caused by his reputation in the Shinsengumi, on his comrades&#8217; activity. The Goryoeji went campaigning in various places such as Ise and western areas, but there is no sign that Todo was involved. The only existing record is that he visited Yataro MIZUNO, a kyokaku in Mino and commanded 300 militiamen who were mainly bakuto (itinerant gamblers). On December 13, 1867, he was killed by the Shinsengumi in Aburanokoji (known as the Aburakoji Incident). According to Shinpachi NAGAKURA (&#8220;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&#8221;), he heard Kondo saying, \\'I&#8217;d like to keep Todo alive&#8217; (since this is an excerpt from a serialized newspaper article using posthumous discourse by a newspaper reporter in the late Meiji period, long after the Meiji Restoration, it is highly possible that this is a fictitious story) so he cleared the way and let Todo get away but Tsunesaburo MIURA, who was unaware of the situation, cut him down. (There is a different theory. According to the &#8220;Tenmatsuki,&#8221; Miura felt such remorse for his actions in Aburanokoji that the wound made by Todo got worse, until sick in mind and body, he died but in the &#8220;Doshi Renmeiki&#8221; by Shinpachi NAGAKURA, he died near Osaka during the Boshin War. According to the &#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221; by Kan SHIMOZAWA, Todo understood Nagakura&#8217;s intention, but he couldn&#8217;t throw away his pride or abandon his comrades, so he fought against the Shinsengumi and was cut down by Tsunesaburo MIURA. Also, it is said that he was cut down from behind by Tsunesaburo MIURA when he understood Nagakura&#8217;s intention and tried to leave. Therefore, there is a theory that Todo fought back until he died from the number of wounds. According to the postmortem report, he was cut from the forehead to nose and the wound was approximately 21cm in length and 6cm in depth, thus he died instantly. His tombstone is inscribed as he died at the age of 24. The tombstone is located in Kaiko-ji Temple and he was buried together with Kashitaro ITO, Kenmotsu MONAI and Takeo HATTORI, who were his comrades and died on the same day. The last tanka he read is thought to be &#8220;A brave man made a pledge of loyalty to the Emperor for seven generations and kept his pledge.&#8221; Existence theory \\nAccording to \\'Heisuke Todo of Aburakoji&#8217; by Haruo TANI in the November 1980 issue of \\'History and Travel&#8217; (Rekisi to Tabi), Todo narrowly escaped death and broke out of the encirclement. It&#8217;s not known exactly how, but he is said to have later lived in Yokohama City and often stopped by Manpuku-ji Temple in Odawara, maybe because a relative&#8217;s daughter had married into the temple family. In Yokohama, he made money on the concession relating to water supply works together with Yoshisuke KONDO, a former member of the Shinsengumi. He passed away Yokohama in 1922 or 1923. He had a son, but his name is unknown.

He was an officer of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. He served as a leader of Sanban-tai troop or a grand master of the Gekken martial art in the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. In the Meiji period, he was promoted by Keishi-kyoku (a precursor to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department) of the Interior Ministry and became a commissary (as a police officer was then called). He held the rank of an assistant police inspector.

He was an officer of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. He served as a leader of Sanban-tai troop or a grand master of the Gekken martial art in the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. In the Meiji period, he was promoted by Keishi-kyoku (a precursor to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department) of the Interior Ministry and became a commissary (as a police officer was then called). He held the rank of an assistant police inspector. He served in the Seinan War as a member of Betsudo-Daisan-ryodan (the third stand-alone brigade), which consisted of commissaries. His Place of Origin He was born as the second son of Yusuke YAMAGUCHI, who had years of experience as a masterless samurai in the domain of Akashi and had become a vassal of Hatamoto (a direct retainer of the shogun), the Suzuki family holding 1,000 koku as its kokudaka (stipend). Some records state that he was from the domain of Aizu, but they are not considered primary materials. Other materials state that when he was in Edo he would hang out in Isami KONDO&#8217;s kendo training hall, the Shieikan training hall, but when KONDO had all the members of Shieikan training hall staying in Kyoto bring weapons to him, SAITO was not included among the members. Officer of the Shinsen-gumi Masterless Warrior Party On April 27, 1863, a group of 13 people, including Kamo SERIZAWA and Isami KONDO formed Mibu-Roshigumi (the Mibu masterless warrior group), which was also called Seichu-Roshigumi, the predecessor of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. They belonged to the domain of Aizu, in which the lord of the domain, Katamori MATSUDAIRA, was in the office of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Military Governor of Kyoto) Title. On the same day, 11 people (including SAITO) joined the group. Another legend states that he had been a cenacle along with KONDO since the years at the Shieikan training hall, and that he had gone to Kyoto with KONDO, but in any case SAITO&#8217;s journey to Kyoto was separate from that of KONDO. However, the people who went to Kyoto with KONDO didn&#8217;t take joint actions. Later, SAITO, who was then 20 years old, was promoted to Fukucho-jokin (third-rank of Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party) in the election of the cadre of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. While Soji OKITA may generally be considered the youngest man among the cadre of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party, the youngest was SAITO (there are several different opinions about OKITA&#8217;s date of birth). He became a group leader upon the organizational restructuring and served as a grand master of the Gekken martial art. In April 1867, when Kinetaro ITO left the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party to form the Goryo-eji (guardians of Imperial mausoleums), party, he left the party with ITO, but eventually he rejoined the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. Some theories assert that he stole the war chest from the Goryo-eji party or had originally infiltrated as a spy for the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party, but his acts during this period of time have not been clarified in terms of the facts and motives. Another theory states that the Abura-no-koji Incident, in which the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party assassinated ITO, had occurred based on the information given at the time SAITO returned. In the Tenmaya Incident, which occurred on January 1 in 1868, he guarded Kyutaro MIURA, the feudal retainer of the Kishu domain, at the request of the domain. While the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party was holding an alcohol-drinking party with MIURA, they were beaten by an attack from members of the Kaientai (Japan&#8217;s first modern corporation established by Ryoma SAKAMOTO) and suffered damage such as the deaths of Nobukichi MIYAGAWA and Kamataro FUNAZU as well as serious injuries to Katsunoshin UMEDO, which occurred in an effort to help SAITO, but the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party was successful in its effort to guard MIURA. The Boshin War He continuously fought the Battle of Toba and Fushimi in January 1868 and the Battle of Katsunuma (Koshu Province) in March 1868. He fought on the front line in both battles. After KONDO surrendered to the new government army in Nagareyama City, he separated from Toshizo HIJIKATA and other members who remained in Edo, and departed for Aizu, leading a number of officers. However, a different theory asserts that at this time SAITO was absent from the line of battle due to his injuries and was not in Nagareyama. According to that theory, the person who had departed for Aizu leading officers was either Masachika KUMEBE or Saisuke YASUTOMI. After HIJIKATA injured his leg in the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle in April of the same year and therefore left the line of battle, he arrived at the castle town of Wakamatsu via Tajima and got together with SAITO and others. The Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party, including SAITO, came under the command of the domain of Aizu and fought in the Battle of Shirakawaguchi on the 26th of intercalary month of May, as well as the Battle of Bonari-toge on October 6. The Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party retreated to Tsurugajo Castle due to the defeat in battle. Amid their retreat, the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party joined HIJIKATA in Inawashiro Town. Later, HIJIKATA departed for the domain of Shonai and a battery of former retainers of shogun, including Keisuke OTORI, went to Sendai to fight, but SAITO remained in Aizu and continued to fight against the new government army outside the castle with feudal retainers of the Aizu domain. After the Aizu domain surrendered on November 6, SAITO continued to fight, but eventually, an envoy sent from &#65323;&#65345;&#65364;&#65345;mori persuaded him to &#65363;&#65365;&#65362;&#65362;&#65349;&#65358;&#65348;&#65349;&#65362; to the new government army. After his surrender, he initially lived in suspension in Shiokawa in the former domain of Aizu, but later lived in Echigo-Joetsu City, along with feudal retainers of the Aizu domain who had been taken as prisoners. Since the Meiji Period After the surrender, the Aizu domain fell subject to Kaieki (the samurai&#8217;s forfeiture of rank and property), and the Matsudaira family became subject to Kamei-Danzetsu (forfeiture of the family name) but on November 3, 1869 was given the right to rebuild the family. The chigyo (fief amount) was set at 30,000 koku in Mutsu Province, and the Matsudaira family was directed to choose either Inawashiro or Shimokita as the domain territory. The former domain&#8217;s cadre, including Hiroshi YAMAKAWA, had been taken prisoner in Tokyo and chose Shimokita without consulting with the feudal retainers who were held in suspension at Takada. It was newly named as the domain of Tonami. SAITO departed for Shimokita Peninsula as a feudal retainer of the Tonami domain. SAITO moved to Gonohe, in the territory of the Tonami domain, and entered his first marriage, to Yaso SHINODA. The Shinoda family was an important family able to be acknowledged from &#8220;Shoshi Keifu&#8221; (retainers&#8217; genealogies) and belongs to highly persons as feudal retainers of the Aizu domain. SAITO was a member of Chu-Nibantai troops in Byakkotai suicide corps and was remotely related to Gisaburo SHINODA who committed a suicide in Mt. Iimori (Fukushima Prefecture). Later, SAITO married Tokio TAKAGI with the support of Katamori as Ue-Nakodo (a go-between after the engagement) and Kambe SAGAWA and Heijiemon KURASAWA as Shita-Nakodo (a go-between from the marriage meeting to the engagement). SAITO and Tokio had three sons: Tsutomu, the eldest; Tsuyoshi, the second; and Tatsuo, the youngest son. All three sons married woman from the Tonami domain. Later, he moved to Tokyo. He applied for employment with a commissary that had recently been established, and was hired. In February 1877, he was appointed to the position of assistant police inspector of Keishi-kyoku. On February 15 of that year, the Seinan War broke out. He joined the Bungoguchi Keishi Chobotai (Bungoguchi Enlisted Commissary Troops) as a member of the &#8220;Army Cutting with a Gouge,&#8221; and in May of the same year he took part in a battle. During the battle he suffered a gunshot, but he prevailed over the Satsuma warriors with his gifted sword technique and generalship. He played an important role, as it was even reported in newspapers of those days that he had captured two big guns. In 1891, he retired from Keishi-cho and then worked as a security guard at Tokyo Higher Normal School, etc. He died of a gastric ulcer on September 28, 1915. According to one legend, he died while seated in an alcove. He was 72 years old. His tomb is located at Amida-ji Temple in Aizu-Wakamatsu City. Personal Profile \\nHis school of swordsmanship is said to have been either the Itto-ryu school or the Mugai-ryu school, but the truth is not known. There is a theory that SAITO was left-handed, but it has little likelihood of being a historical fact. He is described as left-handed in some of the fiction written by novelists, etc., in later years, but in the pictures produced by Nobori NAKAJIMA he was shown holding a sword in the same position as a right-handed person. He was said to be one of the strongest swordsmen in the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party, along with Soji OKITA and Shimpachi NAGAKURA. NAGAKURA told his followers that &#8220;Okita is a swordsman of valor, but Saito is one of invincibility.&#8221; He changed his name four times. He used the name &#8216;Hajime SAITO&#8217; from the relocation in Kyoto through the heyday of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warrior party. His first name was Hajime YAMAGUCHI. According to legend, his first name &#8220;Hajime&#8221; originated from his birthday (January 1), but there is no historical basis for this assumption. In 1862, he ran away to Kyoto since he was involved in a sword-cut incident in Edo, and changed his name to Hajime SAITO. In 1867, he changed his name to Jiro YAMAGUCHI. During the period of his involvement in the Boshin War, he belonged to the domain of Aizu, and he identified himself as Dempachi ICHINOSE. After he moved into the domain of Tonami, he changed his name to Goro FUJITA. He was registered as \\'Goro FUJITA&#8217; in Jinshin-koseki (family registries in Jinshin) in 1872. The &#8220;Different Person&#8221; Story While there is a theory that Hajime SAITO and Goro FUJITA were two distinct persons, currently the &#8220;different person story&#8221; is denied due to the findings that Goro FUJITA had signed invoices of government pension for his older blood brother, Hiroaki YAMAGUCHI, as his relative and that the writing of the \\'Fujita Family&#8217;s notes&#8217; belonging to Goro FUJITA&#8217;s offspring started in the first year he identified himself as Hajime SAITO.

He was the commander of Shuei Shinsengumi (the Shinsengumi unit to guard Toshizo HIJIKATA at the Hakodate war).

He was the commander of Shuei Shinsengumi (the Shinsengumi unit to guard Toshizo HIJIKATA at the Hakodate war). His family name &#8220;Shimada&#8221; can be written in two ways by Chinese characteristics, &#8220;&#23798;&#30000;\"and \"&#23947;&#30000;&#8221;. He changed his first name from &#8220;Kai&#8221; to &#8220;Sakigake&#8221; later. His birthplace was Obusa Village, Katagata District, Mino Province. His real name was Yoshiaki. The pattern of his family crest is what is called &#8220;Maru ni Mitsu Uroko (three pieces of triangular scale surrounded by single circle)&#8221;. Mino Province Kai SHIMADA was born as the second son of Iuemon KONDO, a headman of Obusa Village, Mino Province (present Nagaraobusa, Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture), in 1828. In his childhood, he was adopted by Hanzaemon NAGANAWA living in Ishida Village, Haguri County, Gifu Prefecture (present Kakamigahara City, Gifu Prefecture), whose wife was a sister of SHIMADA&#8217;s real mother, while he was entrusted to Kauemon KAWASHIMA, SHIMADA&#8217;s maternal grandfather living in Hino Village, Atsumi County (present Hino, Gifu City) after Hanzaemon&#8217;s death. In those days, engrossed in Japanese swordsmanship training, he won a championship under presence of the lord of Nagoya castle, with the result that he was adopted by Sai SHIMADA in Ogaki Domain, who was captivated by Kai SHIMADA, to succeed the Shimada family. He went to Edo, and received training at the dojo (hall used for martial arts training) managed by Shume TSUBOUCHI of Shingyoto-school kenjutsu (classical sword tradition). Shinsengumi Although it is uncertain when Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Kai SHIMADA met again in Kyoto, Kai SHIMADA seems to have already joined the Shinsengumi by June 1863. Then, he assumed the post of Shoshi shirabeyaku ken kansatsu. It is believed that he was a man of gigantic build with superhuman strength. In June 1864, bringing his ability into full play as the Shoshi shirabeyaku ken kansatsu, he contributed to the arrest of Shuntaro FURUTAKA, which triggered the Ikedaya Incident. He held the additional post of corporal after the following organizational restructuring. In the Abura-no-koji Street Incident in November 1867, he fought with Takeo HATTORI. In the assault on Isami KONDO, planned by the remaining group of Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums, and also called Kodai-ji Temple party) on January 12,1868, he was traveling along with KONDO as a bodyguard. It was SHIMADA that saved KONDO, who was shot while riding on a horse, by making KONDO&#8217;s horse run. In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 27, 1868, he organized the Kesshi-tai (suicide corps) with Shinpachi NAGAKURA and others, and cut their way into the enemy position. However, the enemy&#8217;s intense gunfire forced them to withdraw. There is an anecdote about him during the war; after having found the heavy-armed NAGAKURA&#8217;s difficulty in climbing over a mud fence, SHIMADA easily pulled up NAGAKURA on the fence with his inborn superhuman strength. Afterwards, he fought on the Boshin War through the battle in Hakodate. After the Meiji period He surrendered in June 1869. He was suspended until December of the same year. Then he was left to the Nagoya Domain, and he started a kenjutsu dojo (training hall for swordsmanship) in Kyoto after the suspension was lifted. Although he was requested to serve the Meiji Government or to visit Takeaki ENOMOTO&#8217;s lodging to renew their friendship, he refused their requests saying; &#8220;If a person had a wish to meet someone, that person must visit him or her&#8221;. He worked as a night guard at Nishi Hongan-ji Temple from 1886. He collapsed at his working place, Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, and died at 73 years old on March 20th, 1900. NAGAKURA attended his funeral. Although his grave had been in Higashi Otani Cemetery, it was removed, so his remains are kept at Otani Sobyo Mausoleum (Higashi Otani) at present. Person After the Hakodate war, SHIMADA regularly prayed to Amitabha for the repose of departed Shinsengumi souls including Isami KONDO, always putting in his bosom the posthumous Buddhist name of Toshizo HIJIKATA, who died in the Hakodate war. He also kept various records and articles including &#8220;Diary written by Kai SHIMADA&#8221; to pass on the Shinsengumi and themselves to future generations. These records and articles are considerable contributions to today&#8217;s research on the Shinsengumi. In the sumo wrestling performance sponsored by the Shinsengumi, he was nicknamed &#8220;Riki-san (a powerful person)&#8221; for his critical plays. He also had such a sweet tooth, ill-matched to his gigantic build, that he cooked a cauldron full of shiruko (sweet adzuki-bean soup) and ate it all up. It is said that other members of the Shinsengumi could not eat this &#8220;Shimada shiruko (shiruko cooked by SHIMADA) &#8221;, because the Shimada shiruko was so sweet as to form sticky threads due to the large quantity of sugar he put in. After he was released from the new government, he returned to Kyoto and started various businesses including a lemonade shop, a variety shop, a kenjutsu dojo, however, it is said that he lived in poverty because his businesses gained little popularity. SHIMADA&#8217;s photograph of his last years, which was taken with his brothers and others, proves that he had frequent communication with his relatives. It is said that such intercommunication left articles belonging to him to the Kishi family and the Naganawa family, both of which were his relatives. SHIMADA seems to have had a taste for literature, leaving a memorial poem for Toshizo HIJIKATA&#8217;s soul. Whenever I view the moon on the battlefield, I cannot help but imagine that the moon may be shining on my dead body tomorrow.

He was born in the Matsuyama clan in Bicchu. His imina (personal name) was Tomokuni. </p><h3>Three brothers of Tani</h3><p>He learned swordsmanship from his father, Sanjiro TANI, during his childhood. It is also told that he was good in spearmanship as well, there might be some confusion with his younger brother, Mantaro TANI. He had served Katsushige ITAKURA, who was the lord of the Matsuyama Domain in Bicchu, but, because of a deplorable event, the Tani family became extinct around 1856 (It is also told that the event is not related to Sanjuro, but to his younger brother, Mantaro TANI.

He was born in the Matsuyama clan in Bicchu. His imina (personal name) was Tomokuni. Three brothers of Tani He learned swordsmanship from his father, Sanjiro TANI, during his childhood. It is also told that he was good in spearmanship as well, there might be some confusion with his younger brother, Mantaro TANI. He had served Katsushige ITAKURA, who was the lord of the Matsuyama Domain in Bicchu, but, because of a deplorable event, the Tani family became extinct around 1856 (It is also told that the event is not related to Sanjuro, but to his younger brother, Mantaro TANI. The truth is not known.). Shinsengumi He joined Shinsengumi before the Ikedaya Incident, and belonged to the Kondo unit at the time of the Ikedaya Incident. In January 1865, on the occasion of police work in Osaka, with a team of four including his younger brother, Mantaro, he prevented a plot of attacking and burning Osaka by radical supporters of the doctrine of restoring the Emperor and expelling the barbarians. (Zenzaiya Incident). After that, in the same year, he was elected to the leader of the seventh unit. (On this occasion, the job as grand master of the art of the spearmanship was made a job for his younger brother, Mantaro. Spearmanship It is told that the spearmanship of Sanjuro TANI was worth &#8216;one thousand koku,&#8217; but, there is the view that his spearmanship was hardly utilized in actual battle and it was mere dojoyari (spearmanship trained only in the training hall). \\n (Also it is considered that he was confused with his younger brother, Mantaro TANI.) \\nIt is also told that Sanjuro failed in conducting kaishaku (to assist someone in committing harakiri by beheading him) for a member, but this is not reliable because, according to the record, the member committed harakiri only after Sanjuro&#8217;s death. Cause of his death On May 15, 1866, Sanjuro&#8217;s dead body was found below the stone steps of the Gion-sha Shrine (present Yasaka-jinja Shrine) in Higashiyama. The cause of his death is recorded as just \\'sudden death,&#8217; and it is not clear how he died. There are two views, and one says that he was assassinated, and the other says that he died because of illness.

Personality He was from Takasago City, Harima Province, and his parents&#8217; home was a wealthy Kuramoto (rice wholesaler). His sister, who married into Shoka (mercantile house) in Osaka recommended him to Shinsengumi, which caused Shinpachi NAGAKURA to refer that Kawai was from Osaka. He played an active role in the accounting of expenses for the group as an accountant, utilizing his skills at arithmetic. Some people believe that he was behind the spear works (military exploits) of other members since he was an accountant. \\n However, some people say that he was as good as the other members since he received rewards for his performance in the Ikedaya Incident; he was active as a &#8216;fighting accountant.&#8217; In March in 1866, he was made to commit Seppuku (suicide by disembowelment). Mystery behind his Seppuku (the followings are the assumed reasons) Because he couldn&#8217;t manage to raise the expense for redeeming Miyuki Dayu, the concubine of Isami KONDO (It seems that there is no link between two issues; redeeming Miyuki Dayu was attempted at the different time from Kawai&#8217;s purge). Because he failed account processing under the process of redeeming another geisha other than Miyuki Dayu. Because he showed his reluctance or gave Kondo critical comments against Kondo&#8217;s lavish expenditure for his women as the person responsible for to control expenses of the group, which led to Kawai&#8217;s being purged. Because Kawai misused Shinsengumi&#8217;s money for unknown reasons. The reason which was adopted in the historic drama of NHK (to be described later). Because Kawai&#8217;s plot to carry out a rebellion was identified. Because he merely used Shinsengumi&#8217;s money for himself. It is unmistakably true that Kawai was purged and died; What happened before Kawai&#8217;s death has not yet been identified. In the historic drama of NHK \\'Shinsengumi!&#8217; in 2004, the reason for Kawai&#8217;s purge was that he lent Kanryusai TAKEDA, the leader of the fifth group, money for him to buy military science texts without Kondo&#8217;s permission. According to another story, Kawai sent an emissary to his parents&#8217; home to borrow money to cover the money for Shinsengumi to avoid committing Seppuku. At that time, there was a trouble at his parents&#8217; home, by which the money from his parents had been delivered just after Kawai&#8217;s Seppuku. His parents, having heard of Kawai&#8217;s Seppuku, became extremely angry and had a great tomb built in Mibu-dera Temple to worship their son, apart from the tomb which was built by Shinsengumi.

He later became a Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums). While many books wrote he had come from Joshu Province, &#8220;Eimeiroku&#8221; (a list of the Shinsengumi members) compiled by Kai SHIMADA wrote he had come from the Kawagoe Domain. Noboru NAKANISHI, whose birth date is unknown, was a disciple of Seiichi ITO and Kashitaro ITO (or Daizo SUZUKI) of the Hokushin Itto school (a classical sword tradition). He attained proficiency in swordsmanship that allowed him to become an acting master. Persuaded by Isami KONDO and Heisuke TODO, he went to the capital (Kyoto) in 1864. He joined the Shinsengumi along with Ito and others. In the 2nd organizational restructuring of Shinsengumi, he belonged to the fourth unit of Shinsengumi headed by Hajime SAITO, and assumed the post of corporal. Appointed to a Goryo eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums) in March, 1867, he seceded from the Shinsengumi. He moved to Gesshin-in sub-temple of Kodai-ji Temple. Different story There are a lot of mysteries in Nakanishi. Juro ABE, a comrade of Nakanishi, recollected the Shinsengumi later and told that Taro SAHARA who had called himself Shinpachiro SHINOZAKI at that time was killed by Nakanishi. Another comrade Yasunoshin SHINOHARA, however, left a note that Jiro TAGUCHI of the Kurume Shingekitai (corps consisted of masterless samurai in the Kurume Domain) murdered Sahara.

He was an instructor of swordsmanship. His real name was written as &#8216;&#38263;&#20489;&#8217; (&#38263; means long), not \\'&#27704;&#20489;&#8217; (&#27704; means eternity), although both have the same reading. His childhood names were Eikichi and Eiji. His posthumous name is Noriyuki. In 1871, he changed his name to Yoshie SUGIMURA. Shieikan Training Hall He was born as the second son of Kanji NAGAKURA, who had a 150 koku stipend as the Edo Jofu Toritsugiyaku (Edo-based liaison) of the Matsumae Domain. He entered \\'Gekikenkan,&#8217; the Shindo-Munen school of swordsmanship training hall led by Jumatsu OKADA III Toshiaki in 1846 at the age of eight. He went to the training hall from the Kamiyashiki (daimyo&#8217;s regular residence) of the Matsumae Domain (near the current Kojima 2 chome, Taito Ward, Tokyo). After his master died four years later, he trained under Sukeemon OKADA and received the Kirigami certificate (the lowest rank) at the age of fifteen. He received the Mokuroku certificate (second rank from the bottom) in 1856 at the age of eighteen. He changed his name to Shinpachi upon coming of age. Later, he left the Matsumae Domain and set out on a journey for training in swordsmanship. During his samurai training, he became a live-in apprentice of Isami KONDO of the Tennenrishin school who had a training hall, Shieikan in Ichigaya in Edo and had disciples in the Tama area in Bushu (Musashi Province). Shinsengumi He participated in Roshigumi with Isami KONDO and others, and became the captain of the second unit when Shinsengumi was formed, playing a central role in Shinsengumi from its early days. NAGAKURA had received a Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency) certificate in the Shindo-Munen school, as with Kamo SERIZAWA, who he kept on friendly terms with. He fought bravely with Isami KONDO and Soji OKITA during the Ikedaya Incident in 1864. NAGAKURA put on a display of bravery while Soji OKITA fell and Heisuke TODO was injured. It is said that Isami KONDO, who had suddenly become famous for his bravery during the Ikedaya Incident, acted selfishly for a while. NAGAKURA resented this and together with Sanosuke HARADA, Kai SHIMADA and others, reported Isami KONDO for committing Hiko-go-kajo (five counts of misconduct) to the Lord of the Aizu Domain, Katamori MATSUDAIRA under the risk of leaving Shinsengumi. NAGAKURA expressed his belief in the report that the members considered KONDO as their leader and intended to follow his instructions but they also considered themselves as his comrades, not vassals. (It is also said that KONDO&#8217;s temporary insolent behavior was incited by Kanryusai TAKEDA&#8217;s misleading account that all the members respected him and thought of themselves as his vassals.) Katamori MATSUDAIRA, who had received the report, guided Isami KONDO into mending his ways and the Shinsengumi recovered its strong unity. Thereafter, NAGAKURA was promoted by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to the status of Mimawarigumi with a salary of seventy bales and rations for three people. During the Abura-no-koji Incident, NAGAKURA purged Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums) with Sanosuke HARADA and others. Heisuke TODO, who had been NAGAKURA&#8217;s sword friend since they met at Shieikan, was a member of the Goryo-eji. Although KONDO said, \\'I want to save Todo&#8217;s life.&#8217; and NAGAKURA attempted to let Heisuke run away, Heisuke was killed by Tsunesaburo MIURA. After Soji OKITA fell ill, NAGAKURA also commanded OKITA&#8217;s Ichibantai (first unit) and completed many important missions. The Boshin War broke out against the army of the new government in 1868. In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi at Kyoto, NAGAKURA showed his courage by leading members of a suicide squad and charging with a sword against the bullet-firing imperial army. After retreating to Edo, he fought in the Koyo Chinbutai (a military unit formed specially for the campaign in the Kai Province), which was the new name for the Shinsengumi. However, the Koyo Chinbutai was defeated and he returned to Edo, which was under the control of the Imperial army. At Edo, he left Kondo and others to form the Seikyotai (or Seiheitai) and continued fighting. He visited the Yonezawa Domain to ask for reinforcement and learned of the surrender of the Aizu Domain during the stay and returned to Edo. He was permitted to return to the Matsumae Domain and was offered protection. He became the son-in-law of Kaian SUGIMURA, who was a Hani (Edo-period doctor working for his domain at a public clinic) in 1871 and moved to Matsumae-cho in Hokkaido. After the Meiji Restoration In 1873 (or 1875), he succeeded as the family head and changed his name to Harunobu SUGIMURA (later to Yoshie SUGIMURA). Later, he moved to Otaru City in Hokkaido. In 1882, he was invited by Kiyoshi TSUKIGATA, who was known as the demon prison head because of his strictness, to become an instructor of swordsmanship at the Kabato Shujikan, or \\'outland prison&#8217; (the predecessor of modern prisons). He served there as an instructor until 1886. After he retired, NAGAKURA returned to Tokyo again and founded a swordsmanship training hall at Ushigome. The Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1891. NAGAKURA volunteered for Battotai (drawn sword squad) at the age of 57. However, his offer was turned down with the reply \\'We appreciate the offer, but&#8230;&#8217;. It is said that NAGAKURA just laughed and said, \\'I guess those from Satsuma cannot accept the help of a former Shinsengumi fighter for fear of losing face.&#8217; After the Meiji Restoration, as one of a few surviving senior members of Shinsengumi, he set up the graves of Isami KONDO and Toshizo HIJIKATA in Itabashi, Tokyo. He moved backed to Otaru again in 1899 because his wife and child had opened a pharmacy in Otaru Ironai, Hokkaido. He lived in the vicinity of Otaru Midori 1-chome (near the former Otaru Shonen Kagakukan (Otaru Juvenile Science Museum)) from 1905. He lived in Hanazono-cho from July 1909. (His house was at the site of the building named &#8220;Otaru Rengo Eisei Kumiai Jimusho&#8221; (office of Otaru Union Health Association) in those days, which was to the left when facing the main front door of the former Otaru Shonen Kagakukan). He loved movies and often went took his grandchildren to the movie theaters. It is said that he said, \\'Kondo and Hijikata died young, but I can experience such wonderful products of civilization because I survived.&#8217; There is an episode about him that he was accosted by the local yakuza at the entrance of a movie theater, but sent them running with his sharp glare and loud yell. (There are also some who said that he fought the yakuza away with a Japanese cotton towel or he had a cane in his hand.) He met the daughter of Isami KONDO, Otowa YAMADA on May 22, 1913. He died in Otaru City, Hokkaido at the age of seventy-six on January 5, 1915 due to blood poisoning from periostitis caused by a tooth cavity. His ashes were buried in separate places: Jutoku-ji Temple in Takinogawa, Kita Ward in Tokyo, Satozuka cemetery (1-ki, 3-go, No.762) in Kiyota Ward, Sapporo City, Hokkaido and the central graveyard in Otaru City, Hokkaido, and other places. Personal Profile Shinpachi NAGAKURA was one of the most skillful swordsmen among the captains of the Shinsengumi. Juro ABE later ranked NAGAKURA first, OKITA second, and SAITO third in order of swordsmanship. He was good at a technique called \\'Ryuhiken,&#8217; where you hold the sword low, push the opponent&#8217;s sword up, and then strike the opponent by bringing the sword down. He married Kotsune, who had been a geiko at Shimabara Kameya in Kyoto but Kotsune died after giving birth to their daughter, Isoko. Isoko was left in the care of Kotsune&#8217;s elder sister when NAGAKURA left Kyoto. In 1900, Isoko became an actress called Kogame ONOE in the Kansai Region and was later reunited with her father. Documents NAGAKURA wrote &#8220;Roshi (masterless samurai) Bunkyu era patriotism articles&#8221;, an important source on the Shinsengumi. He cooperated with a newspaper reporter from Otaru Shinbun to produce &#8220;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&#8221; (Detailed Report on Shinsengumi). NAGAKURA&#8217;s series of works broke the stereotyped idea of considering Shinsengumi as \\'a group of wicked murderers or evil envoy&#8217; and triggered a reconsideration of the Shinsengumi that is still ongoing to this day.

His imina (personal name) was Kazutake. Personal Profile He was said to have been very serious and sincere. There is a story told about Genzaburo passing by the street in Mibu, where Soshi OKITA was playing with children. \\n Soshi asked, &#8216;Are you going to practice?&#8217; and said, \\'You are very diligent,&#8217; Genzaburo replied \\'You should practice, too.&#8217; \\nTamesaburo YAGI said of Genzaburo that \\'Inoue was about 40 years old at the time, very quiet but a good-natured person.&#8217; \\nHe was quiet but warm and was respected by the young Shinsengumi members. On the other hand, he was very stubborn, and he would never go back on his word. Place of origin Genzaburo was born in Hinojukukitabara, Bushuhino City (currently Hinohon-machi, Hino City, Tokyo) the third son of Tozaemon INOUE (also called Matsugoro), who was steward for Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji). His older brother was Matsugoro INOUE, a member of Sennin Doshin (junior officials). Shieikan In about 1847, he studied under Shusuke KONDO, the third generation grand master for Tennenrishinryu swordsmanship, that was spreading around Tama District. He trained along with Toshizo HIJIKATA at a Tennenrishinryu training hall that was set up by Hijikata&#8217;s step-brother, Hikogoro SATO. He was also a senior fellow pupil of Isami KONDO. He built friendships with them from this time. In 1860, he received his Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency). Shinsengumi In March 1862, he joined the Roshigumi (an organization of masterless samurai) recommended by Hachiro KIYOKAWA, along with Kondo and Hijikata. In October 1963, after the purging of the Kamo SERIZAWA group, he was appointed Fukucho jokin (assistant vice commander), and, thereafter, remained executive officer of the Shinsengumi. He supported Kondo and Hijikata, Head and Deputy Head, who came from the same home and training hall, and there was strong trust among them. He was in charge, dealing mainly with outside matters and entertaining important figures. In July 1864, during the Ikedaya Incident, he led a squad of the Hijikata troop, and upon hearing that the Kondo troop had entered by force, he led 10 of his men and captured 8 samurai. Within the Shinsengumi, with many of its members being expert swordsmen, Genzaburo&#8217;s skill was inconspicuous; however, he was very aware of his position and performed his duties without fail. In July of 1865, he was appointed the leader of the 6th group in restructuring of the Shinsengumi. In July 1867, all members of the Shinsengumi were called into service directly under the Bakufu and, as a Fukucho jokin (assistant vice commander), Genjiro was given 70 bales of rice, an annual &#8220;three-man&#8221; rice stipend. However, the Bakufu government was subject to the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor) and Declaration of the Restoration of Imperial Rule, and Genzaburo and his group in the Sabaku-ha (supporters of the Shogun) section of the Shinsengumi were placed in inferior positions. Battle of Yodo-Senryomatsu In January 1868, the Battle of Toba-Fushimi broke out. The Shinsengumi had its quarters transferred to Fushimi at the time; however, it was forced to retreat to Yodo. January 29, the Shinsengumi fought in a fierce engagement with government troops at Yodo-Senryomatsu (Battle of Yodo-Senryomatsu). During the war, he was shot in his stomach and died. He was 40 years old. There is a story told that Genzaburo&#8217;s nephew, Taisuke INOUE tried to take his head home. It was so heavy, though, that others suggested it be buried in the temple near the battleground. Other \\nGenzaburo&#8217;s head and sword were said to have been buried in the nearby temple by his nephew, Taisuke INOUE; however, the exact location is unknown. His grave is at Hosen-ji Temple in Hino City. The grounds of a temple named Gonjo-ji Temple are located in Uji, Kyoto, somewhere between Yodo-Senryomatsu and Yodo-jo Castle, which was demolished at the beginning of Meiji period. There is a temple with the same name, Konjo-ji, next to Inoue&#8217;s birthplace, making it highly possible that his burial ground is this demolished temple.

His given name was Morichika.<br></p><p>Oishi was born the eldest son of Sutejiro OISHI who was the kinjubanshu for the Hitotsubashi family, one of the gosankyo (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family). He was originally referred to as Kinnosuke. Upon his joining Shinsengumi, Oishi was fearfully referred to as &#8216;Kuwajiro the assassin&#8217; with his main duty being to assassinate adversaries. It seems that Oishi frequently wielded his sword on duty.

His given name was Morichika. Oishi was born the eldest son of Sutejiro OISHI who was the kinjubanshu for the Hitotsubashi family, one of the gosankyo (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family). He was originally referred to as Kinnosuke. Upon his joining Shinsengumi, Oishi was fearfully referred to as &#8216;Kuwajiro the assassin&#8217; with his main duty being to assassinate adversaries. It seems that Oishi frequently wielded his sword on duty. He was also assigned the post of a superintendent officer. Due to some circumstances, Oishi ran away from home and was working for a carpenter as a live-in help in Hinojuku, Bushuhino City. Since that carpenter regularly worked for the village headman Hikogoro SATO, Oishi began to attend Hikogoro&#8217;s dojo (training hall). It seems that Oishi became a good swordsman at this training hall. After the Ikedaya Incident in July 1864, Isami KONDO returned to Edo to recruit new members between October and November of that year. It was when Oishi joined Shinsengumi. When Shinsengumi members were made the Shogun&#8217;s retainers in July 1867, Oishi was assigned the responsibility for investigating the adversary movements and keeping the Shinsengumi members under surveillance. During the Abura-no-koji Incident in November 1867, Oishi assassinated Kashitaro ITO. During the fierce sword fighting in the Tenmaya Incident of December 1867, along with other members including Hajime SAITO, Oishi was assigned as a bodyguard for a feudal retainer of Kishu Domain Kyutaro MIURA. In January 1868, being defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, Oishi retreated to Edo with his Shinsengumi comrades. When Kondo organized Koyo Chinbutai, Oishi went on a business trip to Kai Province ahead of the new army. When Koyo Chinbutai retreated in March 1868, Oishi went missing. Oishi subsequently was in hiding with his family in Edo but, around January of the next year, was deceived by the former Shinsengumi member Ushinosuke MITSUI who was a friend of Oishi&#8217;s and was captured. Some say that the destitute Oishi visited Washio KANO, then a member of the pro-Imperial troops and a former member of the faction under Kashitaro ITO who Oishi had killed, begging for a job which Kano rejected when Oishi was captured but there are no records to substantiate this theory. Since the foregoing story contradicts the testimony given by Kano&#8217;s comrade Juro ABE, it is highly likely that it was a fictional account created by the novelist Kan SHIMOZAWA. Being accused of assassinating Ryoma SAKAMOTO, Oishi was subjected to violent interrogation and, at one point, admitted guilt unable to bear the pain any longer, but subsequently retracted his earlier testimony insisting that the assassination was carried out by Mimawarigumi. Oishi was beheaded on November 3, 1870. (On a charge of murder of Kashitaro ITO) Died at the age of 32. According to the testimony of Juro ABE included in &#8220;Shidankaisokkiroku&#8221; (stenographic records of recollections of historical events) a compilation of stories told by old people during the Taisho era, Oishi, along with Soji OKITA and the like, was mentioned numerous times suggesting that he was among the most formidable swordsmen in Shinsengumi. It is said that, to circumvent investigation, Oishi&#8217;s son Raitaro changed his name to Utakichi HONMA and opened a shop to make and sell goods made of turtle-shell in Inari-cho, Shitaya.

He later became the leader of the Goryo-eiji (Kodai-ji-to Party). His imina (personal name that was generally used posthumously or by one&#8217;s parents or lord) was Takeaki. His childhood name was Hiroyuki and his original name was Taizo. His Buddhist name was Seisai. He later went under the name of Utabe. Origin Kashitaro ITO was born as the first son of Senemon Tadaaki SUZUKI, a retainer (Gometsuke) of the Shizuku Domain in Hitachi Province. After his father Tadaaki retired due to a dispute with a chief retainer, Ito inherited the family estate but was expelled because it became known that he was in debt to Tadaaki. Ito left to study in Mito City where he studied swordsmanship (swordplay in Shindo-Munen ryu style) under Kenshiro KANEKO, a retainer of the Mito Domain, learned Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and devoted himself to imperialism. After his banishment, Tadaaki ran a sonjuku (private village-school) (Shunjuku) in Higashi-ohashi (present Ishioka City) where Ito taught after completing his studies and returning to his hometown. He subsequently became a pupil of the Ito Hokushin-ittoryu fencing school in Saga-cho, Fukagawa (Koto Ward) where his ability was recognized by school master Seiichi ITO who adopted him and named him Taizo ITO. Shinsengumi In October 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi through the agency of his fellow student, Heisuke TODO. In November of the same year, he went to Kyoto with his brother Mikisaburo SUZUKI, his colleagues Tainoshin SHINOHARA, Washio KANO and Takeo HATTORI, and his disciples Jiro UTSUMI and Noboru NAKANISHI. It was at this time that he called himself Kashitaro ITO after the name of the year (Kinoene) in which he traveled to Kyoto. He was appointed a staff officer and literary instructor. It is said that Ito won popularity due to his attractive appearance and eloquence. However, Ito agreed with the Shinsengumi on the expulsion of the foreigners, but since the Shisengumi were Sabaku-ha (supporters of the Shogun), he opposed them regarding the policy of loyalty to the Emperor (overthrow of the shogunate). Goryo-eiji On April 24, 1867, after campaigning in Saigoku (western part of Japan (especially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)), he separated from the Shinsengumi to investigate the movements of the Satsuma Domain and receive an official appointment as guard of the Emperor&#8217;s tomb, and formed Goryo-eiji (Kodaiji-to Party) with 14 comrades including Shinohara and Suzuki. However, he rejected requests from Kanryusai TAKEDA and others who were losing their positions within the Shinsengumi to join Goryo-eiji. It was at this time that he named himself Settsu ITO. Assassination On December 13, 1867, Kondo welcomed Ito to house of his mistress where he got him drunk before he was assassinated (Abura-no-koji Incident) on the way home in front of the gate of Honko-ji Temple on Abura-no-koji Street by several Shinsengumi members including Kuwajiro OISHI, and it is said that he died while crying &#8216;you villains.&#8217; \\nHe died at the age of 33. It is thought that they planned to get him drunk before assassinating Ito because he was the master of the Hokushin-ittoryu fencing school. The Ito&#8217;s body was left on the road to lure the Gryo-eiji. The Goryo-eiji members who came to pick up his body were attached by Shinsengumi members, and Todo and others were killed. His tomb is located at Kaiko-ji Temple in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. On April 5, 1968, the Goryo-eiji moved the tomb from Koen-ji Temple in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City. Notes It is said that the Ito school in Sagacho, Fukagawa flourished, had many students and disciples, and had almost the same size as a small direct retainer of the shogun. In 1867, four memorials were addressed to the Imperial Court. The third memorial immediately after restoration of imperial rule advocated that a new government centered on court nobles was established, personnel were called in from various parts of the country with a slogan of Ichiwa Doshin (common wishes or cooperative spirit), five territories in the immediate vicinity of Kyoto were put under direct imperial rule of the new government, and universal conscription was performed. The first memorial insisted on opposition to opening of the Kobe port, but the third one advocated \\'opening of the country (Japan) to the world and enriching it,&#8217; and showed a measure to enrich and strengthen the country by opening it positively (however, it opposed to opening of Kobe port because it was against the will of Emperor Komei). Ito had a draft of the fifth memorial in his inside breast pocket at the time of his assassination, and records of the time state that it was similar to the copy of the third memorial and he wanted to persuade Kondo based on this idea. \\n The then first-rate document \\'Tottori Domain Hinoeushi Nikki&#8217; (Notes) says that Kosuke YOSHII of Satsuma told Yukie NAKANE of Echizen that this memorial was \\'very reasonable.&#8217; The Japanese kanji for Kashitaro (&#30002;&#23376;&#22826;&#37070;) can also be read as \\'Kinetaro&#8217;, but the former reading is correct because the first two kanji of his given name were taken from \\'Kasshi&#8217; (written as \\'&#30002;&#23376;&#8217;, meaning the first year in the Japanese 60-year calendar cycle, which is a year of \\'Kakurei&#8217; when the will of heaven is renewed and heaven&#8217;s decree is revealed to the virtuous); further evidence that Kashitaro is the correct reading is the fact that his name was sometimes written as \\'&#27179;&#22826;&#37070;&#8217; (pronounced \\'Kashitaro&#8217;) in historical records of that time. After separating from the Shinsengumi, Ito advised his comrades to learn English. In the Meiji period, Kazue SOMA was sentenced to exile to Hachijo Island on the charge of assassinating Ito. In 1918, he was conferred the posthumous honor of Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) and was enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in April, 1932. Isami KONDO welcomed the participation of Ito, but it is said that Toshizo HIJIKATA took precautions against him, believing him to be a schemer. When Keisuke YAMANAMI committed hara-kiri, Ito composed four waka poems.

His wife was Mitsu OKITA. He was a brother-in-law of Soji OKITA, the leader of the First Group of Shinsengumi. His imina (personal name) was Fusamasa.<br></p><p>He was born to the Inoue family of Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji).

His first son Yoshijiro OKITA was born in 1853.</p><p>He joined Roshigumi together with Isami KONDO and Soji OKITA in 1863. As a member of the Third Group (headed by Nishiki NIIMI), he went to Kyoto. Although the members of Roshigumi who were from the Tennen Rishinryu school, including Isami KONDO, did not follow the return of Roshigumi to Edo and stayed in Kyoto, Rintaro returned to Edo without following his fellows.

His wife was Mitsu OKITA. He was a brother-in-law of Soji OKITA, the leader of the First Group of Shinsengumi. His imina (personal name) was Fusamasa. He was born to the Inoue family of Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji). He became an apprentice of Shusuke KONDO, learned the swordsmanship of Tennen Rishinryu School and obtained the license. He married Mitsu OKITA in 1846 to become the head of Okita family. His first son Yoshijiro OKITA was born in 1853. He joined Roshigumi together with Isami KONDO and Soji OKITA in 1863. As a member of the Third Group (headed by Nishiki NIIMI), he went to Kyoto. Although the members of Roshigumi who were from the Tennen Rishinryu school, including Isami KONDO, did not follow the return of Roshigumi to Edo and stayed in Kyoto, Rintaro returned to Edo without following his fellows. Roshigumi was later reorganized to Shinchogumi (Tokugawa Shogunate guard organization), put under the control of Shonai Domain, and was in charge of guarding Edo. Rintaro served as the head of a group. When the Tokugawa Shogunate terminated in 1868, Tadazumi SAKAI, lord of Shonai Domain, returned to his home domain, and Rintaro followed him. He returned to Tokyo in 1872. He died in 1883.

He was born in the Iyo-Matsuyama Domain. His Imina (personal name) was Tadakazu. He was trained by Sanjuro TANI in the Taneda-ryu Sojutsu School of spearmanship and received Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency). Personal Profile He was a servant for a samurai family in the Iyo-Matsuyama Domain but later left the domain. He seemed to be a little short-tempered. When a certain samurai had a quarrel with him and said, &#8220;you are of low birth and don&#8217;t even know how to commit seppuku suicide,&#8221; he actually demonstrated it by cutting his own belly. The cut was shallow and not life-threatening. For this wound, he was nicknamed in the group as &#8220;Sanosuke not dead yet.&#8221; Although a straight-lined scar was left on his belly, he used to say, exposing the scar to the sun on a sunny day, &#8220;I am not soft like you guys. My belly knows the taste of metal.&#8221; That was why he adopted as his Kamon (family crest) the design of a circle combined with a straight line representing the scar. He, however, was said to be a devoted husband. He was also quite handsome. Shinpachi NAGAKURA seemed to be close to him. \\n He was quite rough, and when drunk, he would boast the scar on his belly or shout loudly &#8220;kill, kill!&#8221; \\nAfter stabbing to death, from behind, Kojuro KUSUNOKI, a spy of the Choshu clan, he laughed and said, &#8220;Oh, I feel good.&#8221; Later KONDO sternly rebuked him for it. Shinsengumi He had been in the group since he was training at Shieikan, Isami KONDO&#8217;s dojo (training hall) in Edo, and became the leader of the Tenth Unit. He was known as a spear master of Taneda-ryu (or Hozoin-ryu Sojutsu School of spearmanship). It is said that Toshizo HIJIKATA, the Vice Commander, trusted Soji OKITA of the First Unit and Sanosuke HARADA of the Tenth Unit, and often gave them tasks. Commanding the Tenth Unit as the leader of the rear guard, Harada participated in all major fights of Shinsengumi. \\n (The purge of Kamo SERIZAWA&#8217;s faction, killing of Kojuro KUSUNOKI, a spy of the Choshu clan, assassination of Hikojiro UCHIYAMA, a yoriki [police sergeant] of the Osaka-Nishimachi Magistrate&#8217;s office, Ikedaya Incident, Kinmon Incident, Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident, Aburanokoji Incident, and so on.) He was once suspected to have assassinated Ryoma SAKAMOTO in the Omiya Incident. \\n (It was because Kashitaro ITO testified that the scabbard left in the scene was Harada&#8217;s. They also heard the assassin say &#8220;Konakuso! (Damn!)&#8221; with an accent of Iyo Province.) \\nIn fact, however, it is believed that Shinsengumi was not involved in the assassination of Ryoma. \\n (The prime suspect is said to be the Kyoto Mimawarigumi.) \\nThe 2004 NHK Historical Drama &#8220;Shinsengumi!,&#8221; broadcast by Japan Broadcasting Corporation, made good use of the rumor spread at that time that Harada had assassinated Ryoma SAKAMOTO. He had fought as a member of Shinsengumi until the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and the campaign of Koyo Chinbutai (a military unit formed specially for the campaign in Kai Province), and then formed Seiheitai with Shinpachi NAGAKURA. After leaving Edo, however, he strangely returned to Edo, saying that he remembered that he had something to do there, and then joined Shogitai. He was injured in the Battle of Ueno and died from the wound on July 6, 1868. Died at the age of 29. However, for some reason, Harada&#8217;s name was not on the list of squad members. Legend of Mounted Bandit According to a different theory, an old soldier in Matsuyama, during the Sino-Japanese War (also during the Russo-Japanese War), talked about old times and said, &#8220;I am Sanosuke HARADA.&#8221; It is said that Harada went to the continent via Ueno, Niigata City, Shimonoseki City and Busan Metropolitan City, and became a head of mounted bandits. This was reported on the newspaper around 1907, but the truth is unknown. Others His son&#8217;s name was Shigeru. His wife, Masa HARADA, is said to die around 1931, being watched over by many of her grandchildren. She talked about her husband Sanosuke in Shinsengumi trilogy (written by Kan SHIMOZAWA), which was the records of testimonies about Shinsengumi.

There are various theories about his death as described below. Brief Personal History \\nHe was born as a son of a statesman of the Ono clan in Harima Province. He left the domain in Ansei era. He was said to have run a dojo of Sekiguchi-ryu Jujutsu in Osaka. He had joined Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group), the predecessor of Shinsengumi, by May 1863. In the Coup of August 18, 1863, he guarded the front of Sento Imperial Palace and the south gate of Kinri-gosho (imperial palace and residence) with a white headband on his shaven head and a large naginata (Japanese halberd) at his side, just like Benkei, and won the nickname of &#8220;Imabenkei (contemporary Benkei).&#8221; In the Ikedaya Incident in 1864, he belonged to Hijikata&#8217;s squad and received 15 ryo (currency unit) as a reward for his achievement on that night. The group was restructured in April 1865, and he became the leader of the Forth Unit and instructor of jujutsu. He died in 1865. There are various theories about his death. Appearance and Character \\nHe was a big, fair-skinned man with a shaven head. He was known for being mild mannered, and people used to say, &#8220;the kind ones are Yamanami (Keisuke YAMANAMI) and Matsubara.&#8221; There is a story that Matsubara calmed Yamanami when he got upset because there was no armor for him. Nickname of &#8220;Imabenkei&#8221; Matsubara participated in the Coup of August 18 with a white headband on his shaved head and a naginata at his side, in addition to being so big. Because of his unusual look, he is said to have been nicknamed as &#8220;Imabenkei.&#8221; Death of Matsubara \\nThere are two theories about the death of Matsubara: a disease and a joint suicide (It is said to be a disease according to the record of Shinsengumi). Many stories say that he attempted to commit seppuku for some reason but failed, and was then demoted to the lowest rank in the group. The joint suicide theory, however, might have been created by Kan SHIMOZAWA (or Tamesaburo YAGI) as &#8220;Mibu shinju&#8221; (lovers&#8217; suicide in Mibu) in &#8220;Shinsengumi Monogatari&#8221; (the Tale of Shinsengumi). Disease Theory \\nHe attempted to commit seppuku suicide because of a failure, but was stopped, and died from the wound. Joint Suicide Theory \\nShortly after Matsubara became the leader of the Fourth Unit and instructor of jujutsu, he was strongly criticized by Toshizo HIJIKATA, the Vice Commander, for keeping a mistress (wife of a masterless samurai whom he had killed) near their quarters. He felt responsible for it as an executive member and then attempted to commit seppuku. But he failed (soon discovered by Tainoshin SHINOHARA) and was injured. He then recovered and was demoted to the lowest rank in the group. He seemed to have given himself up to despair. After a while, his wound worsened and he died from it. &#8220;Shinsengumi!,&#8221; the NHK Historical Drama of 2004, also follows this theory. Matsubara is stabbed with a knife by a widow of a statesman of the Choshu clan, who avenges her husband&#8217;s death. \\n (The widow is killed at the scene and their deaths are officially treated as joint suicide.) About &#8220;Mibu shinju suicide&#8221; \\nKan SHIMOZAWA wrote &#8220;Mibu shinju&#8221; on Matsubara&#8217;s death, reconstructing the stories that Tamesaburo YAGI of the Yagi family, where Shinsengumi quartered, had heard about him from Tainoshin SHINOHARA and Hajime SAITO. However, it is doubtful whether this story is true, because the works of Kan SHIMOZAWA and stories by Tamesaburo YAGI often contain exaggerations or fictions. Others \\nHis tomb is in the Koen-ji Temple.

He was the leader of the Fifth Unit, instructor of military science and literature, and military commissioner. His real name was Hiroshi FUKUDA. Another surname of his is Tokuhiro. Brief Personal History He left the domain and went to Edo, where he studied the Koshu-ryu military science. He started to call himself &#8220;Kanryusai TAKEDA,&#8221; named after the Takeda clan in Kai Province. In 1863, he joined Shinsengumi. He was promoted as a scholar of military science by Isami KONDO, and was selected as one of the executive members as a Fukucho-jokin (assistant vice commander) in 1864. In the Ikedaya Incident on June 5th of the same year, Takeda and others captured Shuntaro FURUTAKA, who was accommodating Roshi (masterless samurais) in hiding, including those from the Choshu Domain. He then belonged to Kondo&#8217;s squad and guarded the perimeter of Ikedaya. In the fight he killed Kanae OAKI, a Roshi from the Tosa Domain, and received reward money for it. In the Kinmon Incident on July 19, he was responsible for strategy as a military commissioner and demonstrated his mastery of the Koshu-ryu military science in the capture of Mt. Tenno and so on. The group was restructured in 1865 and he became the leader of the Fifth Unit. He trained the group members in the Koshu-ryu military science at the squad, where many members were said to be disgusted with him for flattering the executive members with his eloquent tongue. Shinsengumi later adopted the Western style military training in accordance with the policy of Bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and Takeda&#8217;s military science gradually became outdated. Takeda, who had lost his position in the group, approached Kashitaro ITO with the intention to leave the group, and also attempted to contact the anti-Bakufu Satsuma clan. However, Isami KONDO and Toshizo HIJIKATA detected these actions. On June 22, 1867, Kondo gave a farewell party for Takeda, who had offered his resignation. However, it was, of course, a party to assassinate Takeda. After the party, Hajime SAITO and Tainoshin SHINOHARA left with Takeda to accompany him to the residence of Satsuma Domain in Fushimi. On the way there, he was assassinated by Hajime SAITO at the Zenitoribashi Bridge over the Kamo-gawa River (Yodogawa river system). (There are various theories about the assassin. At that time, Saito belonged to Goryo-eji [guards of Imperial mausoleums], so the assassin might have been another member.) Later, a member called Higuma KATO was ordered to commit seppuku for having conspired with Kanryusai TAKEDA. Episode There is a theory that Takeda was a homosexual. A story says, &#8220;Takeda chased Saburo MAGOSHI, one of the five men of beauty in the group. As a result, Magoshi offered his resignation to Hijikata.&#8221; It is, however, an episode in &#8216;Shinsengumi Monogatari&#8217; (the Tale of Shinsengumi) written by Kan SHIMOZAWA, and is likely to be a fiction.

He was a younger brother of Kashitaro ITO. His childhood name was Tamon. His Birth In 1837, he was born in the Shizuku Domain as the second son of Senemon Tadaaki SUZUKI, a statesman (Gometsuke [inspector of villages]) of the Shizuku clan. His father Tadaaki was later exiled from the domain and opened a private school in the village of Takahama (now in Ishioka City). On the death of Tadaaki, he succeeded to the management of the school. He was later adopted as heir by Masuuemon TERAUCHI, a statesman (Chugosho [the lowest rank of samurai]) of the same clan, and called himself Tamon TERAUCHI. He started to work as Director of Forest and Goshuin-ban (supervisor of official documents) in the domain. However, the adoption was dissolved due to his bad behavior, such as getting drunk. After that, he called himself Arajiro MIKI. Ronin (masterless samurai) Period Mikisaburo, having left the domain in order to work for Sonno Joi Movement (the movement advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners), stayed with his older brother Ito, who was the owner of a dojo (training hall) in Fukagawa, Edo. After the Sakuradamongai Incident, he left Edo where the investigation against Ronin had become more intense, and secluded himself for several years in Taga County, Hitachi Province. When the Tenguto no Soran (Rebellion of Tenguto) occurred, he went back to Shizuku for investigation upon the request by Ito, and when it ended, he did not remain there but returned to Edo. Shinsengumi Period In October 1864, he went to Kyoto with Ito, Tainoshin SHINOHARA and others, in response to the request of his old acquaintance Heisuke TODO to join the group. He then formally joined Shinsengumi. Around that time, he called himself Saburo Miki. After serving as a Metsuke (inspector), he became the leader of the Ninth Unit in 1865. Goryo-eji Period In March 1868, he separated from Shinsengumi with Ito and others, and belonged to Goryo-eji (Kodaiji-to Party). He then called himself Saburo MIKI or Izumi MIKI. In November of the same year, when he went to retrieve the body of Ito who had been assassinated, he was attacked by Shinsengumi but survived the fight, and was sheltered in the residence of Satsuma Domain (Aburanokoji Incident). In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he fought against Shinsengumi under the command of Hanjiro NAKAMURA of the Satsuma clan, and then joined the spearhead convoy of the expeditionary force to the east. He later served as the leader of the Second Unit of Sekihotai Army, but was imprisoned for alleged conspiracy with Sozo SAGARA in the Nise-kangun Incident (incident of fake government forces). Afterwards, he joined the Seventh Unit of conscription army of the new government. In June, he was appointed as a sergeant of the Military Affairs Bureau and went to Edo. During the Boshin War, he fought at the front in the Hokuetsu and Aizu area. From the Meiji Period In July 1869, he became a Sho-junsatsu (a class of inspector) of Danjodai (Board of Censors). After Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), he changed his name to Tadayoshi. He held a position mainly in judicial and police organizations in Ina Prefecture, Ministry of Justice, Chiba Prefecture, Yamagata Prefecture and so on. In 1879, he organized an imperial visit as the chief of Tsuruoka police station. In January 1885, he retired from his last job as Nitozoku (second-ranked junior official) of Fukushima Prefecture, and then spent the rest of his life in Ishioka City, Ibaraki Prefecture. In 1919, he died of old age. Died at the age of 83. His tomb is at the Toyo-ji Temple in Ishioka City. Remarks In 1852, Mikisaburo presided over a private school at the age of 16 after the death of his father Tadaaki. However, he not only neglected to give lessons, but also did nothing but mock battles, flying a flag with large letters of &#8220;Tamonmaru KUSUNOKI&#8221; (childhood name of Masashige KUSUNOKI, known as a paragon of fidelity) written on it. As a consequence, the number of students decreased, which led to the closing of the school. He served as the leader of the Ninth Unit of Shinsengumi, but was later demoted. Although he was good at study and speech, his polite personality was said to be a disadvantage for him. The remnants of Kodai-ji Party attacked Isami KONDO near Sumizome in Fushimi, but it is unknown whether Mikisaburo was one of them.

He hailed from Osaka in Settsu Province (another theory is that he hailed from Yamashiro Province). He was the son of a doctor or a drug wholesaler, and he learned first aid from Ryojun MATSUMOTO, who was engaged in the treatment of the members of Shinsengumi. According to a book written by Ryojun MATSUMOTO, Yamazaki said, with a smile, that &#8220;I am a doctor of Shinsengumi.&#8221; Shinsengumi Around 1864, he started to be engaged in investigating the movement of members as well as collecting the information. When the Ikedaya Incident occurred in July, he, as a Shoshi shirabeyaku ken kansatsu of Shinsengumi, searched for, along with Kai SHIMADA, the retainers of Choshu domain and radical members of Sonjo-ha (a group advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) and succeeded in locating Masuya, the residence of Shuntaro FURUTAKA, one of the radical members. Masuya was the place where influential activists, including Teizo MIYABE etc., held secret meetings. It seems that he located Masuya by shadowing Miyabe&#8217;s servant Chuzo. Thanks to the above, Shinsengumi successfully blocked the plans of Sonjo-ha to set fire on the palace and to bring the Emperor to Choshu. Although other members of Shinsengumi were given rewards for this achievement, Yamazaki&#8217;s name was not on the list. Therefore, some people assert that the above story is a fiction created by Kan SHIMOZAWA and Ryotaro SHIBA. In the diary of Kai SHIMADA who received a reward, however, Yamazaki was listed as a member who went searching. He is said to have excelled in bojutsu (art of using a stick as a weapon) of Katori school, but some people believe that what he actually used was a nagamaki (a long sword). It seems that he knew well about Osaka, and he often brought leading members to Osaka as a guide. He also knew well about rich merchants in Osaka. It seems that he was found useful in Shinsengumi. In the subsequent important battles such as the Kinmon Incident, the first conquest of Choshu and the second conquest of Choshu, he showed his ability in collecting information on the progress and situations of a battle and provided accurate information to Isami KONDO and the Aizu domain. He learned medicine from Ryojun MATSUMOTO and worked also as a doctor of Shinsengumi. Working as a doctor, he made his colleagues laugh by saying &#8220;I am a doctor of Shinsengumi.&#8221; In February 1968, he was seriously wounded in the battle of Toba-Fushimi. On February 6th, he died from high fever on a ship called Fujisan (warship) while retreating to Edo. It is believed that he was buried at sea off the coast of Kishu. It is said, at that time, Isami KONDO shed tears and said to Toshizo HIJIKATA, &#8220;Yamazaki was a good guy. He is happy with being seen off by so many people.&#8221; Thereafter, he is said to deeply bow to the captain and express his thanks. However, no description concerning Yamazaki&#8217;s death and water burial is seen in the notes written by Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Kai SHIMADA who may have been on the same ship. One theory is that he was shot to death in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and was buried on land. As seen from the above, his death is covered in mystery with various views. Kondo seems to have trusted and loved Yamazaki. At the water burial held on the ship, Kondo is said to go out of the bed to be dressed up and read his message of condolences, although he was also shot and heavily wounded in the shoulder. Some people assert that he was a cousin (brother in law) of Ringoro YAMAZAKI (Shinjiro HAYASHI), a member of Shinsengumi, and that he should have a wife based on the family tree of Ringoro&#8217;s family, but it is not certain whether he actually had a blood relation with Ringoro in the first place. He was deemed as a cousin of Shintaro HAYASHI in a book written by Kan SHIMOZAWA, but Shimozawa might have been confused with Shinjiro HAYASHI. \\n (There is this description in this book that Shintaro HAYASHI told about the water burial of Susumu YAMAZAKI in the late Meiji era, but the truth is that he had already died at that time.) \\nFurther, there is a view that the name of Ringoro YAMAZAKI&#8217;s father and that of Susumu YAMAZAKI&#8217;s father were the same, but they were not the same person. In Ryotaro SHIBA&#8217;s novel &#8220;Shinsengumi Keppuroku,&#8221; he was depicted as a descendant of Shogen OKUNO, who dropped out of Ako Roshi (lordless samurai of Ako domain), but it is a fiction. Diary A diary named &#8220;Yamazaki Susumu Torishirabe Nikki&#8221; was found in 2004. It seems to be a kind of memos recording the list of the Shinsengumi members as well as the events in Keio era, and its decipherment work is currently under way. It was exhibited at Furusato Museum in Hino City for the first time at the end of the year.

He was commonly called Saburobe. </p><h3>Biography</h3><p>He was born as a son of a statesman of the Ako clan in Harima Province in 1832. </p><p>He joined Shinsengumi, and in October 1864, belonged to the Fifth Unit led by Shuntaro OGATA. In the spring of 1865, he became a Shoshi shirabeyaku ken kansatsu (Shinsengumi&#8217;s organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control) and instructor of Gekken martial art. In December 1865, he accompanied Isami KONDO on his trip to the Choshu Domain. In October 1866, he worked as a Metsuke (inspector) in the Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident.

He was one of the top executive members like Soji OKITA and Shinpachi NAGAKURA. Shuntaro held a post of Shoshi-torishirabe ken Kansatsu (Shinsengumi&#8217;s organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control) and of Master of Literature. He also served as Head of the group number 5, Fukucho-jokin (assistant vice commander) and Metsuke (superintendent officer). He was from the Kumamoto domain of Higo Province (Kumamoto Prefecture). His family name &#8216;Ogata&#8217; is written also as &#32210;&#26041; or &#23567;&#24418;. Shinsengumi Shuntaro joined Shinsengumi sometime after July 10, 1863. He was appointed Fukucho-jokin in the organizational formation in July of the same year. Although he is considered to have participated in the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), but he was not involved in the Ikedaya Incident of June 1864. He could have been busy guarding Shinsengumi&#8217;s headquarters or could have been sick as there was recordedly a lot of sickness in Shinsengumi at that time. He was appointed Head of the group number 5 in \\'Kogunroku&#8217; (&#34892;&#36557;&#37682; which can be translated literally as \\'marching record&#8217;, but is actually a combat team formation) established in December 1864 for the preparation of the conquest of the Choshu domain. Isami KONDO seems to have had great trust in Shuntaro, which is illustrated in the fact that Shuntaro was given an important position from an early stage of his career in Shinsengumi and that he accompanied Isami Kondo in all important trips such as the trip to Edo in 1864 to recruit new members for Shinsengumi and the two trips to Choshu (Nagato Province: Yamaguchi Prefecture) in 1865 and 1866. He was appointed Shoshi-torishirabe ken Kansatsu and Master of Literature in the organizational formation in May 1865, which indicates he was highly appreciated as a civilian. Having been Fukucho-jokin in Shinsengumi, Shuntaro was recruited as a Mimawarigumi-kaku (a status which is equivalent to Mimawarigumi; the shogunate-organized security squad placed in Kyoto) at the time of recruitment of Shinsengumi members as shogun&#8217;s retainers in July 1867. He served as Metsuke when the Battle of Toba-Fushimi broke out in January 1868, and returned to Edo after taking flight to Osaka. Having remained in Shinsengumi after that, he headed for Aizu (western part of Fukushima Prefecture) following the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, and was routed at the Battle of Bonari-toge Pass of October 6, 1868. Nothing has been heard of him since his last record of the fact that he and his 38 colleagues including Jiro YAMAGUCHI alias Hajime SAITO stayed in an inn called Saitoya located at the foot of Aizu-Wakamatsu-jo Castle outside its outer moat in October 7, 1868. Ogata and Saito were the only assistant vice commanders of Shinsengumi who stayed with the group and went up to Aizu. Movements Ogata&#8217;s movements in the last part of his life are not clear. \\n Nobori NAKAJIMA (a Shinsengumi member) wrote that \\'he was missing&#8217; and Jingoro YOKOKURA (same) recorded that \\'he stayed in Aizu Wakamatsu-jo Castle.&#8217; \\nIn any case Ogata seems to have been away from the then Shinsengumi&#8217;s headquarters and there are many views on his movements, none of which has been evidenced. He stayed in Aizu until his death. He kept on fighting together with the Sendai clan soldiers and surrendered in Sendai. He returned his home Kumamoto and taught the art of sword in the local police. After moving to Tokyo and working there as a secret agent under a name Tanji KOGA together with Hajime SAITO (who called himself Goro FUJITA at that time), he became a fire station chief and was killed in the performance of his duties in 1904. Incidentally, a story has been handed down that there had been a grave of a Shinsengumi member named \\'Ogata&#8217; together with a grave of Kijiro MATSUMOTO in Shofuku-ji Temple in Miyo of Aizu, which is not certain.

He was commonly called Yahei or Shiro. His imina (personal name) was Toyokuni. </p><h3>Biography</h3><p>In 1843, he was born as a son of a feudal retainer of Satsuma. In 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi and belonged to the Nanaban Ozutsu gumi (seventh platoon in charge of cannon), and in 1865, he held the position of corporal. Later, he took part in setting up the squad of Goryo-eji with Kashitaro ITO and others. In the Aburakoji Incident, he managed to escape from the scene, and he was sheltered by the Satsuma clan. Afterwards, he assaulted Isami KONDO on the Fushimi-kaido Road with other remnants of the Goryo-eji such as Juro ABE. </p><p>During the Boshin War, he was with the Satsuma clan. Although he was dedicated to investigate the movement of the Aizu Domain, staying in Izumozaki Town, Echigo Province, he was caught by Mito Tengu-to (antiforeigner faction of Mito Domain), and although he once tried to escape, his attempt failed and he was killed. He was 26 years old. </p><h3>Remarks</h3><p>It is said that he joined the Shinsengumi, because he was motivated by Toshimichi OKUBO, who was sent as a kanja (spy) of the bakufu.

He was commonly called Yahei or Shiro. His imina (personal name) was Toyokuni. Biography In 1843, he was born as a son of a feudal retainer of Satsuma. In 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi and belonged to the Nanaban Ozutsu gumi (seventh platoon in charge of cannon), and in 1865, he held the position of corporal. Later, he took part in setting up the squad of Goryo-eji with Kashitaro ITO and others. In the Aburakoji Incident, he managed to escape from the scene, and he was sheltered by the Satsuma clan. Afterwards, he assaulted Isami KONDO on the Fushimi-kaido Road with other remnants of the Goryo-eji such as Juro ABE. During the Boshin War, he was with the Satsuma clan. Although he was dedicated to investigate the movement of the Aizu Domain, staying in Izumozaki Town, Echigo Province, he was caught by Mito Tengu-to (antiforeigner faction of Mito Domain), and although he once tried to escape, his attempt failed and he was killed. He was 26 years old. Remarks It is said that he joined the Shinsengumi, because he was motivated by Toshimichi OKUBO, who was sent as a kanja (spy) of the bakufu. Before he was admitted as a member, he was suspected to be a spy, as he was from the Satsuma Domain, but finally he was admitted thanks to the mediation of Ito. According to an oral tradition, when Toyama was killed, he was skewered about 50 times all over the body. His body was buried at the battle field, but it is said that later a mass grave was constructed in Takada, Joetsu City, Niigata Prefecture, and his body was moved there. Later, he was enshrined at Yasukuni-jinja Shrine.

Induction in the Shinsengumi and change of the times In 1854, he was born as the third son of Hanzaemon ICHIMURA, a retainer of the Ogaki Domain. In 1859, his father Hanzaemon was cast out from the domain, and he grew up in Kunitomo-mura Village, Omi Province (present Nagahama City Shiga Prefecture), where his relatives were living. In 1867, he joined the Shinsengumi at the age of 14 with his older brother Tatsunosuke as it was accepting application. Tatsunosuke ICHIMURA was assigned to ryochoho(long gunner) and Tetsunosuke was ordered to work under Toshizo HIJIKATA (Kai SHIMADA&#8217;s Eimeiroku [Record of Shinsengumi members]). Afterwards, all the members were promoted to immediate retainers of Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and he became a Shogun&#8217;s retainer at the age of 14. However, November 1867, the bakufu disappeared due to Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), and in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in January 1869, the former bakufu army lost the battle against the allied force of Satsuma Domain and Choshu Domain. The Shinsengumi once left Kyoto to withdraw to Edo (present Tokyo) and although it returned again to Kyoto as &#8216;Koyo Chinbutai&#8217; (a military unit formed specially for the campaign in Kai Province) to fight against the Imperial army, it suffered a crushing loss again. He withdrew again to Edo. Escape to Hakodate After returning to Edo, he was engaged in recruiting the members of the Shogunate Infantry. Around this time, his older brother Tatsunosuke ICHIMURA ran away from the Shinsengumi. After the detention of Isami KONDO, Head of Shinsengumi, the remnants fought the battles in the Aizu Domain as well as in present Fukushima City and Sendai City, and finally they reached Ezo (present Hokkaido). Tetsunosuke ICHIMURA accompanied Hijikata as his page, and Hijikata commented about Tetsunosuke that \\'he was extremely strong-minded and at the same time very clever.&#8217; \\nAround May 1869, he was prepared to die in battle with Hijikata but Hijikata ordered him to leave Hakodate, and he abandoned the force, consigned to keep Hijikata&#8217;s belongings. Three months later, he escaped the Imperial army&#8217;s encirclement, and in safety reached the house of Hikogoro SATO a Hijikata&#8217;s relative. Tetsunosuke stayed during some two years at the HIKOGORA SATO, and then he returned back to his parents home and held a reunion with his older brother, however, he died of illness in 1873. According to the story handed down by the Kishi family, a relative family of Kai SHIMADA, Tetsunosuke supported the side of Takamori SAIGO and died in battle. Later this anecdote was cited in &#8220;Shinsai shigen&#8221; (Shinsai sayings) and others, and converted into a well known history. However, at present there is no such oral tradition left in the Kishi family (according to the interview survey on the Kishi family in 2005).

He was a relative of Toshizo HIJIKATA. He is the first son of Tomohachi MATSUMOTO, the nanushi (village headman) of Honshuku Village, Tama Country, Musashi Province (present Honshuku, Fuchu City, Tokyo). </p><p>He learned swordplay in Tennenrishin-ryu school at Kondo Dojo training hall, and he wanted to join Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) which was established in January 1863, but he gave up because of his family&#8217;s objection. Afterwards, he went up to Kyoto and in December 1863, he was rejected the enlistment of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded Kyoto at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), the predecessor of which was Mibu-Roshigumi, even though he asked for it anxiously. It is said that the reason of the reject is because he was the first son. Even afterwards, he did not give up to persuade his parents, and it was in 1867 when he finally achieved to join the Shinsengumi. He took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and the Koshu War. During the Aizu War, he left the Shinsengumi while he was in Sendai and returned to his home town. </p><p>After the Meiji Restoration, he ran a rice dealer in Aichi Prefecture, and late in life he lived in Hachioji City (Tokyo). In 1889, when the nephew of Toshizo HIJIKATA, Toshinobu SATO was excused from lese majesty, Sutesuke also went to meet him. His grave is found at the Honshuku public cemetery in Fuchu City, Tokyo. </p><h3>Fictions</h3><p>In Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)&#8217;s period drama &#8220;Shinsengumi!,&#8221; Sutesuke TAKIMOTO performed by Shido NAKAMURA (the second), a personality modeled on Matsumoto, played an active part.

He was a relative of Toshizo HIJIKATA. He is the first son of Tomohachi MATSUMOTO, the nanushi (village headman) of Honshuku Village, Tama Country, Musashi Province (present Honshuku, Fuchu City, Tokyo). He learned swordplay in Tennenrishin-ryu school at Kondo Dojo training hall, and he wanted to join Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) which was established in January 1863, but he gave up because of his family&#8217;s objection. Afterwards, he went up to Kyoto and in December 1863, he was rejected the enlistment of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded Kyoto at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), the predecessor of which was Mibu-Roshigumi, even though he asked for it anxiously. It is said that the reason of the reject is because he was the first son. Even afterwards, he did not give up to persuade his parents, and it was in 1867 when he finally achieved to join the Shinsengumi. He took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and the Koshu War. During the Aizu War, he left the Shinsengumi while he was in Sendai and returned to his home town. After the Meiji Restoration, he ran a rice dealer in Aichi Prefecture, and late in life he lived in Hachioji City (Tokyo). In 1889, when the nephew of Toshizo HIJIKATA, Toshinobu SATO was excused from lese majesty, Sutesuke also went to meet him. His grave is found at the Honshuku public cemetery in Fuchu City, Tokyo. Fictions In Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)&#8217;s period drama &#8220;Shinsengumi!,&#8221; Sutesuke TAKIMOTO performed by Shido NAKAMURA (the second), a personality modeled on Matsumoto, played an active part. In the drama, he was a childhood friend of Kondo and Hijikata, and the first son of a wealthy farmer. He was an active young man who seemed to be everywhere at once. In the TV drama based on the historical fiction, &#8220;Moeyo Ken&#8221; (The Blazing Sword aka Turbulence) by Ryotaro SHIBA, a personality appeared with the identical name based on the historical fact as Sutesuke (performed by Shigeru INOUE). \\n (Broadcasted in 1970, Production: Nihon Educational Television, Ltd.

Among the members of Shinsengumi, those who lived the experience of the Ikedaya Incident and later went down to Hakodate surviving various fights during the Boshin Civil War were reduced to only three; Kai SHIMADA, Masajiro OZEKI and this Kango ARIDOSHI, except for Toshizo HIJIKATA, and in this sense, he was an rare person. It should be noted that he stayed at the lowest rank for his entire career, although he was one of the oldest members from the outset of Shinsengumi.

His personal name was Hajime, and from the Meiji Period he served as one of tonomori (an occupational group in charge of the care and maintenance of all the palace buildings). Biography Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) He was born as a son of Heihachiro-Yoshikata FUNABASHI, a retainer of the Kasama Domain in Hitachi Province. After he left the domain in 1865, he applied for the recruitment of Shogunate Infantry, and was stationed in Mitsuura (present Matsuyama City, Aichi Prefecture) during the Second Conquest of Choshu. Afterwards, he was discharged from the infantry, and joined the Shinsengumi. However, the date of the enrolment in the Shinsengumi is not clear (according to one theory, it was in October 1867). By the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that broke out in January 1868, he had already joined the force. Probably, he must have been a probationary member when the Tenmanya Incident occurred. Later, in the Koyo Chinbutai (a military unit formed specially for the campaign in Kai Province) he distinguished himself as the chief of the direct attendant group on Commander, and when Isami KONDO surrendered to the New government army in Nagareyama and presented himself at the government-general in Itabashi, Soma visited Itabashi to beg for Kondo&#8217;s life with the letter of Shogunate Army Gunjikata (officer in charge of military affaires), Gennojo MATSUNAMI. However, as Kondo had been already captured, Soma was also detained there as a Kondo&#8217;s ally. Though Soma was scheduled to be executed on May 17, 1868 together with Kondo, thanks to Kondo, who begged for Kazue&#8217;s life, he and Risaburo NOMURA, who was also captured, were spared from the execution, and they were ordered to put a rein on their own behavior under the custody of the Kasama Domain. After a while, he escaped from the domain, and joined the Shogitai (group of former Tokugawa retainers opposed to the Meiji government who fought in the Battle of Ueno). He later entered into the Shogunate Army to work under the direction of Saemon KASUGA, and after the Shogitai (group of former Tokugawa retainers opposed to the Meiji government who fought in the Battle of Ueno) was fallen apart to pieces, he fought in one place after another toward the Iwaki Province with other former Tokugawa retainers. Later, he met Hijikata again in Sendai. After having fought in various battles, he reached Hakodate Goryokaku, which was the final field of the Boshin War, and he took charge of controlling Hakodate City mainly. After Toshizo HIJIKARA, who was leading the Shinsengumi, died in battle on June 20, 1869, the Shinsengumi members staying in Benten Daiba (Cape Benten Battery) presented a letter of obedience to the new government with the name of Soma at the head of the letter as Commander, which finally closed the curtain on the history of the Shinsengumi. According to Ryoun TAKAMATSU&#8217;s letter, Soma&#8217;s assumption of the commander was on June 24, 1869. Meiji Period and later On November 3, 1870, Soma was alleged to have assassinated Kashitaro ITO and was condemned to transportation, and deported to Nii-jima Island of Izu. In the island he opened a terakoya (small private school) under the custody of a master carpenter, Jinbei UEMURA. Later he got married with the first daughter of Jinbei, Matsu. In 1872, he was pardoned and lived in a place called &#8216;Kuramae&#8217; in Tokyo with his wife Matsu. Next year, he began working for the Toyooka Prefecture (former Toyooka Domain) as the 15th rank attendant, probably with the backing of Uchu ONO, who was Gonsanji (second to the governor) of Toyooka Prefecture (former Toyooka Domain) at that time. In 1874, he was promoted to the 14th rank attendant and worked in the judicial branch. Death In February 1875, he was suddenly dismissed from his post probably because of an internal conflict in Toyooka Prefecture, and returned to Tokyo. Afterwards, in popular lore he committed suicide. According to that, when Matsu returned home, the paper screens were stained in bloody red and Soma had already committed disembowelment without being assisted. With his last breath, Soma himself strictly ordered Matsu \\'not to breath a word of it,&#8217; and since Matsu kept his order until she died, the details and motive as well as the temple where he was buried are unknown to date.

He was assigned to bear a flag, leading the march. Later, he called himself Izumi OZEKI (&#23614;&#38306;&#27849;). Around 1863, he joined Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) (the predecessor of Shinsengumi) and he took part in the Coup of August 18. He did not participate in the Ikedaya Incident. He submitted a petition together with other members, who had a backlash toward Isami KONDO, such as Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Sanosuke HARADA. After he returned to Edo (present Tokyo), being defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he went over to Hakodate (Hokkaido) with Toshizo HIJIKATA, Kai SHIMADA, Kazue SOMA and others to fight against the opponents but finally he surrendered. After that, he was detained at Goyakuo-in Temple. On February 28, 1892, he died in his home town, Takatori-cho, Nara Prefecture. He was 49 years old. His grave is in Koun-ji Temple.

His childhood name was Mankichi. Sanjuro TANI was his older brother and Shuhei TANI was his younger brother. Biography He was born in Matsuyama, Bicchu Province, as the second son of Sanjiro-Tomoyuki TANI, who was a feudal retainer of Matsuyama Domain of Bicchu Province (Hatabugyo [flag magistrate], with a stipend of 120-koku crop yield and a yakuryo [executive allowance] of 20-koku). He started learning martial arts from his father, Sanjiro, since his infancy. Around October 1856, the Tani family extinguished due to a certain scandal. After the family name was forfeited, he left his home town with his older brother, Sanjuro. He became a guest freeloader of Higonojo-Fumihiro IWATA, who was the jii (a doctor for the Emperor and the Imperial family) for the Nakayama family, a family of high court noble, and later he took his daughter Sue to wife and opened a dojo (training hall for martial arts) in Horie-cho, Osakaminami. Around 1863, he joined the Shinsengumi. In the Ikedaya Incident, he belonged to Hijikata-tai (the squad lead by Toshizo HIJIKATA) and received a financial incentive of 20-ryo (old currency unit). After the organizational shuffle in January 1965, he was assigned to Nibangumi-tai (the second squad). In the Zenzaiya Incident in Osaka, he killed Teikichi ORI, in cooperation with his older brother Sanjuro, Juro ABE and others. While he was in Osaka, he held the position of the leader of quarters, however, as he often acted individually, it seems that he left the Shinsengumi after the death of his brother Sanjuro, although his enrolment until that period is confirmed. After the Meiji Restoration, he continued running the dojo in Osaka. During the Seinan War, he acted for a while as the provisional head of Batto-tai (suicide squad, literally called drawn sword squad) recommended by Governor of Osaka Prefecture, Noboru WATANABE. \\n Afterwards, he failed running the dojo, and he spent the rest of his life as Yojinbo (the bodyguard) of a merchant family \\nLater, he divorced his wife Sue and lived together without getting married with his lover, Tami YOSHIMURA. In 1886, he died of esophageal cancer in Osaka. He was 51. His grave s located at Honden-ji Temple in Kita Ward, Osaka City. Biography Juro ABE was his discipline when he was running the dojo. After the Meiji Period, he was associated with Yasunoshin SHINOHARA. He was a skilled hand of the sojutsu (spearmanship) of Taneda-ryu school and the kenjutsu (swordplay) of Chokushin-ryu.

He also held the position of Fukucho jokin (assistant vice commander). He was born in Bizen Province. He was also called Totaro. He was a mysterious member of the Shinsengumi. It is said that he joined the Shinsengumi around 1863, but the details are unknown. In the Ikedaya Incident, he belonged to the squad lead by Isami KONDO, and received an incentive of 20-ryo (old currency unit). He made a condolence song dedicated to the members victimized in the Akebonotei Jiken (Akebonotei Incident). Until this moment, he had called himself &#8216;Totaro ASANO.&#8217; This name can not be found in any documents written after that, even in records of march nor in &#8220;Eimeiroku&#8221; (a list of name of the Shinsengumi) written by Kai SHIMADA.

Later, he became a Shinsengumi corporal. He fought in many battles up to the Hakodate War with other members, such as Toshizo HIJIKATA, Kai SHIMADA, and Kazue SOMA. Brief personal history He was born on February 25, 1838 in Ono, Tama Country, Musashi Province (present Nishiderakata-machi, Hachioji, Tokyo) as the first son of a farm family. His childhood name was Minekichi. His father was Matakichi NAKAJIMA and his mother was Ichi NAKAJIMA. Around September or October 1856 when he was 19, he became a discipline of a master of swordplay in Tennenshinri-ryu school, Manjiro YAMAMOTO. In 1857, he got married with Masu ANDO of the same village. His first son Utakichi (later called Toichiro)was born. Afterwards, he belonged to Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji), but as he put one of his colleagues of Sennin Doshin to the edge of the sword, having a conflict with him, he ran away to his relative&#8217;s house (Masugoro INOUE&#8217;s family), leaving the Sennin Doshin. In 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi. It is said that under the orders of the Shinsengumi&#8217;s Head, Isami KONDO, he was carring out confidential duties such as topographical surveys in Kai Province and Sagami Province. In 1867, he was appointed as a Shinsengumi corporal. On April 25, 1868, when Isami Kondo surrendered to the New government army, he tried to tail the movement of a feudal retainer of Satsuma Domain, Tota ARIMA, but he could not keep tailing owing to Satsuma&#8217;s severe vigilance, and returned in vain. He was incorporated in the former Edo bakufu army (the army of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), together with several Shinsengumi members, such as Toshizo HIJIKATA and Kai SHIMADA, and fought in a series of battles, from the Battle of Utsunomiya and Battle of Nikkoguchi to the Aizu War (it is said that Nakajima carried Seishin OSHIMA, a member of Shogitai (a group of former Tokugawa retainers opposed to the Meiji government who fought in the Battle of Ueno) who was seriously injured in the Aizu War, to an aid station). Afterwards, he joined the former Edo bakufu army with Takeaki ENOMOTO in Sendai and others and went over to Ezo (present Hokkaido). During the Hakodate War, he took the charge of the leader for the second squad of Benten Daiba. On June 24, 1869, he surrendered. He was ordered to put a reign on his behavior at Benten Daiba. Later, he was transferred to Aomori and on July 17, 1869 he was moved to the Hirosaki Domain, and after returning to Aomori on August 28, he was obliged to behave himself for three months. On November 27, 1869, he returned to Benten Daiba and he was obliged to behave himself for five months there. In early June 1870, he was placed under the custody of Sunpu Domain, and in the middle of the same month, he was definitively released. He returned home in Tama district. He dedicated himself to develop rural lands in the Shizuoka Domain. He ceded the arable lands he developed to the people. In Hamamatsu he reunited with Seishin Oshima, who was a former colleague of the Shogitai and a scrivener of the register office affiliated to Hamamatsu Court at that time. He was settled in Hamamatsu. On February 19 1879, he invited his first son Toichiro to live in Hamamatsu. He jointly ran a business of pawnbroking with a former shogunate retainer, but failed. In 1881, by chance he developed a new breed of the aspidistra (Aspidistra elatior) from those he was cultivating. This new breed, which was named &#8216;Kingyokuren&#8217; (literally, golden bead curtain) in a fair, brought him a burst of sales. However, one day a horse ate up the parent stocks and he had to close the business. In 1882, he got remarried with Yone, the first daughter of a fish merchant, Hanbei SAWAKI. On April 20, 1882, Toichiro got married with the third daughter of Hanbei SAWAKI. In 1884, he was licensed as a &#8220;gun and gunpowder trader.&#8221; \\n He opened his own shop, \\'Nakajima Gun and Gunpowder.&#8217; On April 2, 1887 he died in Hamamatsu City. He was 50 years old. His grave is in Tenrin-ji Temple in Yamashita-cho, Hamamatsu City. His posthumous Buddhist name is Ryukeiin Koan Gichu-koji. Death haiku (Japanese poem) Nakajima left the following death poem on January 1, 1887. Although the pass of 50 seemed to me very high, once easily getting over, the peaceful spring reigns over the world. Kakun (family percept) of the Nakajima family Nakajima left the following principles as the family percept. a) Don&#8217;t express your preference about what you eat. b) Never play games of chance like Igo or Shogi. c) Never ever pawn your article nor lend money for generations.

He was a skilled equestrian of Otsubo-ryu school, and served as a master of equestrian art for the Shinsengumi. Afterwards, he became Fukucho (vice commander). Rikugun bugyo soeyaku (magistrate&#8217;s assistant of the Shinsengumi army troops) His imina (personal name) was Masanori. He was born as the child of Masanoshin YASUTOMI, who was a feudal retainer working as kanjogata (an accounting officer) in the Ashimori Domain. Around November 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi. After serving as an accountant, he became an equestrian master. It seems that he was highly trusted by Toshizo HIJIKATA. After the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, he parted his ways with Hijikata, but they reunited in Aizu. He went over to Ezo (present Hokkaido), and he became a direct subordinate of Toshizo HIJIKATA, who was appointed Rikugun bugyo nami (the associate magistrate of the Shinsengumi army troops). After Hijikata died in the Hakodate War, Yasutomi, who was by Hijikata&#8217;s side when he died, wrote a notice of Hijikata&#8217;s loss and asked Chikara TACHIKAWA to forward it to the Hijikata family. The former Edo bakufu army (the former army of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) surrendered to the New government army. It is said that although he was discharged in 1870, he was killed by one of the former Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums), Juro ABE, however, this story is not confirmed. However, recently a grave that can be presumed his was discovered at Denjo-ji Temple in Ashimori (present Ashimori, Kita Ward, Okayama City), and on it the date of death is engraved as May 28, 1873. Yasutomi&#8217;s letter delivered by Tachikawa is still kept by the Hijikata family, and in it there is a piece of eulogy poem that Yasutomi dedicated to Hijikata. In swift stream, alas! you have run out of strength, homeward sweet fish. (However, according to another theory, this is the death haiku (Japanese poem) of Toshizo HIJIKATA himself.)

His imina (personal name) was MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki. He was from the estate of Heinai (&#24179;&#20869;) KATO, who was a hatamoto (direct retainer) of Mino Province. He can be identified as a person called &#8216;Kaichi&#8217; according to Shumon ninbetsu cho (a census register by religious sect). The time of his enrollment in the Shinsengumi is unknown, but in the record of the military buildup at Goheishinden district in March 1868, Nomura&#8217; s name can be found. In the next month, April, when Head of Shinsengumi, Isami Kondo presented himself at the station of the New government army in Nagareyama of Shimousa Province, he accompanied Kondo and was also captured. Afterwards, although Kondo was executed on May 17, 1868, Nomura, who was also scheduled to be executed together with Kondo, was released with Soma, another captive, thanks to Kondo&#8217;s pleading for their lives. After he was released, he worked together with Kazue SOMA, under the direction of Saemon KASUGA, who was the commander of the former Edo bakufu&#8217;s army forces (Edo bakufu was the last Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He fought against the government army at Jobanguchi, in tandem with the Oetsu-reppan alliance. After the Oetsu-reppan alliance was abrogated, he went to Sendai and joined Takeaki ENOMOTO fleet, Toshizo HIJIKATA and others, and crossed the sea to Ezo (present Hokkaido). Nomura did not return to the fold of the Shinsengumi, and although he was exclusively in charge of a squad of the army forces, he was not satisfied with the commander Kasuga&#8217;s leadership and caused various troubles including disobedience to Kasuga&#8217;s orders. After the Ezo Republic was established, he held the post of Rikugun bugyo soeyaku (magistrate&#8217;s assistant of the Edo bakufu&#8217;s army forces), the post which was under Hijikata&#8217;s direct control. It is said that during the Battle of Miyakowan Bay, Nomura was on the warship Kaitenmaru, and on May 6, 1869, he took the initiative to cut into the enemy&#8217;s warship positioned in the East. Nomura died in this battle. It is said that his squad was about to withdrew, but he was killed on the ironclad warship and his body was thrown away into the sea by the New government army. He was 26 years old. His name is engraved on the memorial for the Shinsengumi located at Hakodate Shomyo-ji Temple.

Another name was Juro TAKANO. After the Meiji Restoration, he changed his name into Takaaki. Biography In 1837, he was born in Habiro Village, Yuri County, Dewa Province as a second son of Tarobe ABE, a farmer. He learned swordmanship from Mantaro TANI in Osaka and joined Mibu Roshigumi (later, it became the Shinsengumi) in 1863.. He played an important roll with Tani in Osaka Zenzai-ya incident (attack in a sweet-red-bean shop to defeat anti-Tokugawa shogunate samurai). It is said that he left the group in 1864 and later, in 1865, he returned to it. In the Shinsengumi, he served as gocho (a corporal) and hojutsu shihan (instructor for gunnery). However, in March 1867, he left it and organized Goryoeiji (a group to protect Emperors&#8217; graves) with 12 people including Kashitaro Ito. Luckily, he was not involved in Aburanokoji no hen (Aburanokoji incident) because he was out at that time. Later, when he knew the incident, he escaped to the residence of Satsuma Domain. He and the remnants of Goryoeiji who were waiting for the day when they could get revenge attacked and injured Isami KONDO in Fushimi Sumizome. In the Boshin War, he worked under Hanjiro NAKAMURA, statesman of the Satsuma clan and joined in wars including the battle of Toba-Fushimi. Later, he joined in Sekihotai or Sekiho Amy (a group of Japanese political extremists). After the war, he served as a public officer such as danjodai (police or supervisor for public servants) and a pioneer and also, he worked in the Hokkaido development commission (1886-1947). After he retired, he ran an orchard in Sapporo (Hokkaido Kaju Association), cultivating fruits such as apples. In 1907, he died in Tokyo. He died at the age of 71. Notes It is said that after the Meiji Restoraion, he killed Saisuke YASUTOMI, a former member of the Shinsengumi.

Later, he held a subordinate position of artillery, His Buddhist name was Dokugan Kyokai or Takabayashi Kyokai. It is said he had a manly feature with big eyes and thick eyebrows. He seemed to have a broad-minded attitude and a strong sense of duty. He was born in a fishing village, Kanezakiura Munakata County, Chikuzen Province (the land of Fukuoka Domain, Oaza Kanezaki, Genkai-cho, Munakata County, Fukuoka Prefecture which was later merged into Munakata City) as the son of Kiroku, a merchant. It is unknown when he entered the Shinsengumi. It is said that he was a close aide to Isami KONDO, the leader of the Shinsengumi. After he was defeated in the Battle of Koshu Katsunuma and Isami KONDO turned himself up the new government in Nagareyama City, Shimousa Province, he went separate ways from Toshizo HIJIKATA, the deputy leader and headed for Aizu with Hajime SAITO (Jiro YAMAGUCHI) and Saisuke YASUTOMI. When Aizu War broke out, Old Shogunate military which had withdrawn to Sendai joined the fleet with Takeaki ENOMOTO as its commander. They also joined Toshizo HIJIKATA and moved to Ezo (inhabited area of Ainu). When Toshizo HIJIKATA was killed in Hakodate War, he was there and entrusted to deliver a letter to the Hijikata family from Saisuke YASUTOMI, rikugunbugyo soeyaku (a person who support the army leader conveying the command or giving instructions). Then, he tried to escape from Hakodate, but he was seized by the new government. It is said that the YASUTOMI&#8217;s letter was delivered by Chusuke SAWA, bacho (a person who was in charge of taking care of horses). He was confined in Kubota Domain and afterward, sent to Aomori in September 1869 and then, transferred to Hyobu sho, Tokyo Hyobu sho (the government agency in charge of military affairs) in November, and after that, he was confined in his hometown, Fukuoka Domain. After he was granted a pardon, he visited Hikogoro SATO who lived in Hino taking a collection of tanka (poems) paying a tribute to the memory of Toshizo HIJIKATA and a diary in his own handwriting with him. After that, he entered the Buddhist priesthood and entered Gankuzan Itoku-ji Temple, Soto sect located in Hatakura Village (present Otsuki City), Tsuru County, Yamanashi Prefecture on the recommendation of Ichidakusai SAITO, a former member of the Shinsengumi. He used the name, &#8216;Dokugan Kyokai&#8217;. After he entered the Buddhist priesthood, he continued keeping in touch with Hikogoro SAITO and Takeaki ENOMOTO who survived the Hakodate War. In 1875, he served as the twelfth chief priest of Miyashitayama Saiho-ji Temple in Katsura Village, Tsuru County, in 1885, he served as the twenty-third chief priest of Koyozan Jizoin Temple in Kasugai Village (in the past, it was Kasugai-cho, at the present, it is Fuefuki City), Higashi Yamanashi County and then, in 1903, he died. It is said that he died at the age of 69 or 64. At the Hakodate War, he was a close aide to Toshizo HIJIKATA and he held memorial services for the repose of HIJIKATA&#8217;s soul for all his life. His daughter, Haruko, built his grave in Jizoin Temple in September 1924.

Later, he called himself as Saburo KAWAMURA. He lost his father when he was two years old and mother when he was 10 years old. He lived near the Edo Shieikan (a training hall of swordplay) from a child. In October 1864, he entered the Shinsengumi at the age of 22 in response to recruitment. He served as a corporal of the Shinsengumi. In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he got injured; however, he joined an army at the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma and participated in the Aizu War. Got separated from the main force of the Shinsengumi during the Battle of Bonari-toge, he reunited with Shinpachi NAGAKURA, who formed the Seikyotai (Seiheitai), and they went to the Yonezawa Domain together. When he was leaving for Ezochi (inhabited area of Ainu) after hearing of the crossing of Takeaki ENOMOTO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, and others, KONDO was captured by the new government army in the castle town of Yonezawa-jo Castle and sent to Edo. During the questioning by the new government, he did not reveal that he was a member of the Shinsengumi, saying that he was just a Shogun&#8217;s retainer. He was put under the custody of the Shizuoka Domain and then sent to Kyoto for examinations. After that, he was released in 1870. He started working as a lawyer in Minami Ota-cho, Sumiyosi Town, Yokohama, and assumed office as a prefectural governor in 1887. Afterward, he served as a member of a municipal assembly and a prefectural assembly. The letters that were sent to Seii TAKAHASHI, who also was a member of the assembly, have been kept as valuable historical materials about the Shinsengumi. He maintained exchange with the Shinsengumi survivors including Hajime SAITO. He died in 1922. He was 80 years old.

After he visited Toshizo HIJIKATA, who was recuperating, and researched the war situation, he joined the Shinsengumi in Sendai. He joined Takeaki Enomoto&#8217;s fleet, and went to Ezo. Under Hakodate Government (Ezo Republic), he became an immediate subordinate of Toshizo HIJIKATA who took office as &#38520;&#36557;&#22857;&#34892;&#20006; (the corresponding post of an army commissioner), and then, he served as Hijikata&#8217;s assistant from the battle at Fatamataguchi to the all-out assault of Hakodate. After surrender, he presented himself at the New government. In 1871, he became gon-sanji of Kumihama Prefecture and gon-sanji of Toyooka Prefecture. Moreover, he successively hold important posts in Chiba, Nagano and Aomori Prefecture. He also wrote down a record of the Hakodate war (&#8220;Hakodate Senki (the Record of the Hakodate War).&#8221; He died in 1911. He died at the age of 76. Death of Toshizo Hijikata According to Ono&#8217;s literary work &#8220;Hakodate Senki&#8221;, Ono saw Toshizo HIJIKATA who was on the way to Hakodate City at Chiyogaoka jinya (regional government office), and accompanied him to Ippongi kanmon (a barrier). Since the warship of the New government army, Cyoyomaru, was torpedoed and sunk by the warship of the former army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Banryumaru, in Hakodate Port, they made an attack toward the direction of Benten Daiba (Cape Benten Battery) by Hijikata&#8217;s command. \\n Although soldiers took flight one after another, it is said that Ono believed that &#8216;Hijikata certainly stopped them at Kanmon.&#8217; \\nHowever, when Ono was surprised that there was no sign of decreasing the number of soldiers who took flight and returned to Chiyogaoka jinya, he was told by his colleagues such as Torao OSHIMA and Saisuke YASUTOMI that Hijikata was killed in the war. After that, he told Kazue SOMA who visited to Goryokaku to meet Hijikata about his death. It is said that Ono surrendered to the enemy with other Shinsengumi members at Benten Daiba, however there is also a different view concerning this.

He trained swordplay in Hokushin-Ittoryu style. His imina (personal name) was Masatsune.<br></p><p>In May 1865, he applied for recruitment of Shinsengumi members by Toshizo HIJIKATA, Kashitaro ITO and Hajime SAITO, and joined the Shinsengumi at the age of 17.

He was also known as Michinosuke KANO. He was from Izu Province, and his martial style was Hokushin Itto-ryu kendo school. His was formerly known as Taro IZU. After the Meiji Restoration he identified himself as Michihiro KANO. In 1839, he was born as the first son of Bampei TAKANO in Kano Village, Kamo County, Izu Province. He went to Edo at a young age to enter the Ito kendo training hall for Hokushin Itto-ryu kendo school located in Fukagawa-saga Town. He studied under Kinetaro ITO (later, Kinetaro), the school manager, while also working with Tainoshin SHINOHARA at the Kanagawa Magistrate&#8217;s office (also where Jibu\\'uemon KUBOTA worked) on security for Yokohama City&#8217;s Enclave for foreign residents. In October 1864, he went to Kyoto and applied for the position of members of the Shinsen-gumi masterless warriors&#8217; party with ITO and succeeded in getting the position. He became a corporal upon an organizational restructuring in spring of the following year; but, in April 1867, he left Shinsen-gumi masterless warriors&#8217; party to join the Goryo-eji party (Kodaiji-to party)&#8211;organized by ITO, its leader. In November of the same year, he successfully avoided trouble in the Abura-no-koji Incident, which involved the assassination of ITO by the Shinsen-gumi masterless warriors&#8217; party, and was sheltered at Satsuma-Hantei (Satsuma domain&#8217;s residence maintained by a daimyo in Edo). On January 12, 1868, he assaulted Isami KONDO on Fushimi-kaido Road together with Tainoshin SHINOHARA and the others of the Goryo-eji (guardians of Imperial mausoleums) party to retaliate against him for his involvement in the Abura-no-koji Incident. In the Boshin War, which began with the Battle of Toba and Fushimi in January 1868, he fought battles along with the Sekihotai Army and then the Satsuma army. On April 26 of the same year when he was in Itabashi camp he discovered Isami KONDO, who was disguised in an attempt to run away, among the soldiers of the Bakufu army who surrendered themselves to the government forces in Shimousa Province. He carried to his grave an obsession with the idea that Isami KONDO was the man who killed Ryoma SAKAMOTO. After the Meiji Restoration, he worked as a Hokkaido Development Commissioner, at the No-Shomusho (Agriculture and Commerce Department) (Japan) etc., and in October 1902, died in his residence in Azabu, Tokyo Prefecture. He died at the age of 64.

His former name was Tsuguji SHINOMURA. Posthumous name is Mitsumoto. The SERIZAWA family has the surname of TAIRA and is said to descend from TAIRA no Narimoto of Hitachi Heishi. His father was Geki Sadatomo SERIZAWA. His life Parentage He was born as the third son of Sadamoto, then the head of the SERIZAWA family; this family originated from a powerful family named SERIZAWA that arose during the middle ages in Serizawa Village, Hitachi Province, became a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate through distinguished services in the Battle of Sekigahara and subsequently became a Senior Goshi samurai of Mito Clan. Childhood name was Genta. Later on, he became an adopted son-in-law of Yusai SHIMOMURA, a Shinto priest of Matsui Village (present-day Nakago-cho, Kitaibaragi City, Ibaragi Prefecture), and named himself Tsuguji SHINOMURA (written as &#21987;&#21496; in kanji characters; there are also views that the name was written as &#32153;&#21496; or &#21987;&#27425;). However, there are several views regarding his parentage and the year of his birth. For example, in &#8220;Eimeiroku&#8221; written by Kai SHIMADA, he is referred to as the son of Mataemon SERIZAWA and is said to come from a branch family, but there are no corresponding words in the description for the house of Mataemon SERIZAWA in &#8220;Suifukeisan&#8221; which covers the lineage of Mito Clan warriors. Mataemon SERIZAWA&#8217;s ancestor is the same as that of Geki SERIZAWA, the powerful SERIZAWA family in the middle ages. As for military arts he was taught Shinto Munen-ryu swordsmanship by Kumataro TOGASHI, received Menkyo Kaiden and served as an associate instructor. Tengu-to Party Tsuguji left Matsui Village to accomplish the principles of Sonno-joi, and at the end of 1860, he joined Tamatsukuri-gumi which was the predecessor of Tengu-to Party. They were based in Tamatsukuri Village (current Tamatsukuri, Namegata City, Ibaragi Prefecture), and in order to carry out Joi (exclusion of foreigners) in Yokohama City they actively engaged themselves visiting and collecting funds from wealthy merchants and wealthy farmers around Ishioka (current Ishioka City), Tamatsukuri and Itako (current Itako City). On this occasion, Tamtsukuri-gumi carried banners that read, &#8220;always remember one&#8217;s lord&#8221; and &#8220;devote oneself, the Japanese spirit.&#8221; Records indicate that from around this time Tsuguji began using an iron-ribbed fan which later became his trademark (source: &#8220;Ino-ke Bunsho&#8221;). However, because Tengu-to Party collected funds not only from within the domain of Mito Clan but also from land directly governed by the Tokugawa shogunate, and also because of rampant blackmailing on the pretext of Joi under the name of Tengu-to Party the Tokugawa Shogunate instructed Mito Clan in February of 1861 to restrain the activities of men who carried the idea of Joi; Mito Clan changed its policy [accordingly]. Leaders of the Clan close to Tengu-to Party were changed, and when Shosei-to Party which was opposed to Tengu-to Party gained power, Tamatsukuri-gumi was immediately suppressed. In April, Tsuguji was also arrested and imprisoned on the grounds of forcing contributions in the region around Sahara. He was awaiting execution, but in 1862, Toranosuke SUMIYA and others successfully manipulated the Imperial Court and enabled the Tengu-to Party to regain political power in Mito Clan; this, in turn, resulted in Amnesty Order in December that targeted the release of political prisoners who participated in Ansei Purge, and Tsuguji was allowed to leave prison. It is said that he changed his name to Kamo SERIZAWA on this occasion. Lead commander of Miburoshi-gumi On February 5, 1863, he brought along Jusuke HIRAMA, who was from the same homeland and also a family member of one of the SERIZAWA Family vassals, joined the Roshigumi, a group formed in Edo upon the proposal by Hachiro KIYOKAWA, and was appointed Kogashira of Rokuban-gumi Group. Isami KONDO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, Keisuke YAMANAMI and others from Shiei-kan, a kenjutsu school in Edo, later joined the Roshigumi also, and they acted together until they arrived in Kyoto. They arrived in Kyoto on the 23rd. SERIZAWA, together with KONDO and his followers, stayed at the residence of Gennojo YAGI, a Goshi samurai of Mibu. The Roshigumi came to Kyoto to guard Seii Taishogun; in order to make the Roshigumi the vanguard of real Sonno-joi the founder of the Roshigumi, Hachiro KIYOKAWA, submitted a letter to the Imperial Court and succeeded in placing the Roshigumi under direct control of the Imperial Court. On the 29th, when KIYOKAWA summoned his comrades and announced a return to Edo in order to carry out Joi SERIZAWA and KONDO objected against this; they requested to remain in Kyoto and left the Roshigumi. A total of 13 men, including 5 comrades of SERIZAWA and 8 comrades of KONDO, chose to remain in Kyoto at that time. Yoshio TONOUCHI and Yuzan NEGISHI also joined this group. On March 10th, a written petition signed by 17 men (according to another story, by 24 men) was submitted to Aizu Clan. Aizu Clan decided to make them &#8220;Oazukari,&#8221; samurais [temporarily] serving the Aizu Clan. SERIZAWA and others placed their military post in the house of YAGI family (they later also lodged at the houses of MAEKAWA and NANBU families), and on this occasion named themselves &#8220;Miburoshi-gumi.&#8221; At that time, an internal conflict occurred, and after the assassination of TONOUCHI and the withdrawal of NEGISHI and his comrades from the group on the 26th, Miburoshi-gumi was controlled by SERIZAWA party and KONDO party. Subsequently, SERIZAWA, KONDO and NIIMI became commanders, and among them, SERIZAWA became the lead commander. Although they became &#8220;Oazukari&#8221;, they initially received no payment of wages, and in April, SERIZAWA, KONDO, and others went to Osaka and were provided funds from merchants. However, as such blackmail-like funds collection disgraced the reputation of Aizu Clan, the Clan later provided allowances. On June 3rd, 10 men including SERIZAWA and KONDO went to Osaka City to exercise control over &#8220;lawless Roshi Samurai&#8217;s&#8221;. On their way to Osaka, when sumo wrestlers they encountered on the road did not give way, SERIZAWA and others assaulted them. Comrades of the sumo wrestlers angered by this act rushed to the scene which resulted in a scuffle; some of the sumo wrestlers died or were injured. Toshiyori of the Onogawa stable of sumo wrestlers apologized and this incident was settled, but Hikojiro UCHIYAMA, the yoriki of the office of Osaka Town Magistrate, made an issue of this incident; this angered KONDO, and UCHIYAMA was later assassinated by Shinsen-gumi (there are different views regarding who assassinated him). In the same month, when SERIZAWA learned through Aizu Clan that Kuyogata of Minakuchi Clan complained of Miburoshi-gumi&#8217;s violence SERIZAWA became furious; he sent Shinpachi NAGAKURA, Genzaburo INOUE, and others to the residence of Minakuchi Clan, and they threatened the man in charge to apologize and obtained a letter of apology. As the letter of apology was written at the arbitrary decision of the man in charge, Kuyogata, who feared that the incident would be exposed, persuaded SERIZAWA through a mediator in order to retrieve the letter of apology; it was decided that SERIZAWA would return the letter, and a party was held at Shimabara Sumi-ya Geisha House. However, SERIZAWA, who got violent when he drank, behaved extremely violently and forced an order on the owner of the Geisha House, Tokuemon SUMIYA, to suspend operation for 7 days (outrage at Sumi-ya Geisha House). On August 18th of the same year, upon the August 18 Incident, SERIZAWA left with KONDO, NIIMI and other members of Miburoshi-gumi to defend the Imperial Palace, but the warriors of Aizu Clan guarding the gate [of the Imperial Palace] held out their spears and did not allow them to pass because they did not know about the Miburoshi-gumi. As both parties shouted &#8220;let us through&#8221; &#8220;we will not let you through&#8221; to each other, SERIZAWA advanced forward, laughing loudly. When Aizu Clan soldiers pointed their spears at him, SERIZAWA composedly fanned the tips of the spears with his iron-ribbed fan and laughed. Army Commissioner of Aizu Clan rushed to the scene and allowed Miburoshi-gumi through, and SERIZAWA went through the gate calmly. It is said that people were astonished by SERIZAWA&#8217;s fearlessness. (&#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun&#8221;) Upon this mobilization of Miburoshi-gumi, Aizu Clan gave them the name of Shinsen-gumi. Assassination In September 1863, because Geigi Kotora of Yoshida-ya Geisha House, with whom SERIZAWA was in love, refused his advances he became angry and marched into Yoshida-ya, terrified the owner by saying that he would destroy the Geisha House; he also summoned Kotora and her attendant, Geigi Oshika, and committed the outrage of making them cut their hair (&#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokoku Kiji&#8221;). On the 13th, KONDO and others cross-questioned Nishiki NIIMI (then demoted to vice commander), who belonged to SERIZAWA party, about the sin of such violence and outrage, and made him commit hara-kiri(&#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokoku Kiji&#8221;). On the 14th, the incident at Yoshida-ya became a problem, and the Imperial Court ordered the arrest of SERIZAWA which resulted in a secret order by Aizu Clan to KONDO, HIJIKATA, YAMANAMI and others to take appropriate measures against SERIZAWA. There is a view that these outrageous acts of violence were only an outward reason and that they viewed SERIZAWA as a danger because he had a background in Mitogaku in addition to his strong idea of Sonno-joi of Tengu-to Party. On the 16th (according to &#8220;Kawase-ke Monjo&#8221; which is left by a former warrior of Mito Clan, 18th according to &#8220;Shinsen-gumi Ibun,&#8221; etc.), Shinsen-gumi held a party at Shimabara Sumi-ya Geisha House with all of the Geishas attending. SERIZAWA, together with Goro HIRAYAMA, Jusuke HIRAMA, Taizo HIJIKATA and others, left Sumi-ya relatively early, returned to the residence of YAGI at Mibu, and held another party there. At the party, Oume, SERIZAWA&#8217;s lover, Geiko Kichiei of the Geisha House Kikyo-ya, who was intimate with HIRAYAMA and Geiko Itosato of Geisha House Wachigai-ya, who was intimate with HIRAMA, were waiting for them, and SERIZAWA and others who were deeply drunk slept with the women after the party was over. At midnight, when heavy rain was falling, a few men rushed into the room where SERIZAWA was sleeping, murdered HIRAYAMA who was sleeping in the same room, and tried to slash SERIZAWA. SERIZAWA, astonished, jumped out of bed and tried to reach for his sword but failed, then rushed naked into the next room where YAGI family was sleeping but stumbled over a small table for reading books, at which point the assassins slashed him into pieces; the assassins left after killing SERIZAWA. HIRAYAMA&#8217;s head was cut off from his body, and Oume, who was sleeping in the same bed as SERIZAWA, was also brutally murdered with her head cut off. HIRAMA, who was in another room, escaped. Kichiei and Itosato were also unharmed, and are said to have disappeared. According to &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun,&#8221; Masa YAGI, the wife of Gennojo YAGI, saw Taizo HIJIKATA vigilantly keeping a watch throughout the night; she also noted that Soji OKITA and Sanosuke HARADA were undoubtedly at the scene of the assassination, and that Keisuke YAMANAMI was probably there also. According to &#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokoku Kiji&#8221; by NAGAKURA, the assassination was conducted by HIJIKATA, OKITA, Heisuke TODO, Isetake MIKURA, and some others. According to &#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221; by Kanefuji NISHIMURA (a samurai serving at Nishi Honganji-Temple where Shinsen-gumi placed their military post), the assassins were HIJIKATA, OKITA, YAMANAMI and HARADA. The view that this incident occurred on the 18th is taken by &#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221; and &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun,&#8221; but there is also an opinion that there was no rainfall during the night of 18th and that the incident occurred on 16th when there was rainfall; there is no fixed view yet. The incident was reported as doings of Choshu Clan, and a grand funeral of SERIZAWA and HIRAYAMA in Shinto style was held on the 18th (on the 20th, when in accordance with the view that assassination took place on the 18th). On the 20th, KONDO sent a letter regarding the chain of events of the incident to Hikogoro SATO, who lived in Tama, KONDO&#8217;s hometown. SERIZAWA&#8217;s tomb is at Mibu-dera Temple in Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto City. Character Regarding SERIZA&#8217;s personality, details are described in &#8220;Shinsengumi Sanbusaku&#8221; written by Kan SHIMOZAWA (&#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221;, &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun&#8221;, Shinsengumi Monogatari\", and for each there is a pocket-book version published by Chuokoron Shinsha), but it is said that each book includes significant fiction, and it is necessary to note that they significantly lack accuracy as historical materials.) SERIZAWA was tall, stout, had a fair complexion and small eyes. He was a larger-than-life man of some consequence, and always held in his hand an iron-ribbed fan, on which it was inscribed, &#8220;Kamo SERIZAWA, a most devoted warrior for his country&#8221;. He liked alcohol and used to start drinking in the broad daylight, and there was never a time when he was not drunk. Although he is often described as a hopelessly violent villain in novels and TV dramas he also had open-hearted aspects which can be seen in such cases as: when Shinsen-gumi members had to borrow Montsuki kimonos from YAGI family upon visiting Katamori MATSUDAIRA, the Head of Aizu Clan, for a petition Gennnojo YAGI worried that they would all be bearing the same family crest (an extremely ridiculous situation at a public occasion), but SERIZAWA laughed, not minding at all; or when SERIZAWA came secretly to return a hibachi he borrowed from YAGI family, YAGI questioned him about cuts made by swords on the hibachi (when the members got drunk, they tested out their swords on randomly selected furniture that belonged to the YAGI family), but SERIZAWA said &#8220;it&#8217;s me, it&#8217;s me&#8221; and scratched his head and escaped. Also, when a young daughter of YAGI family died, SERIZAWA, together with KONDO, stood at the reception desk and actively lent a hand in conducting the funeral, and it is also said that he was liked by children for whom he drew funny pictures to kill his time. He had a strong desire to carry out Sonno-joi, and presented a frame to Kitano Temman-gu Shrine, in which the poem &#8220;Before snow and frost melt, colorful flowers are in bloom, and the scent of plumb blossoms remain even after they fall&#8221; was written. The family members of the house where SERIZAWA was born were in the medical business during and after the Edo Period, and the current descendants continue to operate a clinic in Ishioka City, Ibaragi Prefecture. Even now, the medicine &#8220;Sujiwatashi&#8221;, which has been handed down through generations of SERIZAWA family, is prescribed. Works Kamo SERIZAWA and Mito Group often appear in films and TV dramas about Shinsen-gumi. Most of the time SERIZAWA is portrayed as an ill-mannered villain, and in cases where his assassination occurs at the beginning of the story in a short period of time his role is played by an actor with a large build and a sinister look, and he is easily assassinated by HIJIKATA and OKITA. We will introduce a few cases where SERIZAWA is one of the major characters. TV drama, &#8220;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#8221; (1965 - 1966) (1965-1966, NET channels). SERIZAWA was played by Tatsuo ENDO. SERIZAWA and Mito Group were nothing but utter villains. ENDO was an actor who often played the part of a dishonest administrator, and Mito Group was described as if they were dishonest administrator and his subordinates. SERIZAWA raped the female owner of the dyer who prepared the Shinsen-gumi&#8217;s banner of loyalty (the owner was so ashamed that she killed herself), also slashed the master craftsman who was innocent, then scuffled with the craftsmen who were apprentices under the master (modified version of the scuffle with sumo wrestlers in Osaka), furthermore, raped Oume who was the sister of the master (Oume became insane), and continued other vicious deeds; he was eventually slashed as a punishment by HIJIKATA, OKITA and others. This is a typical story about rewarding the good and punishing the evil. ENDO also played the part of SERIZAWA in TV dramas &#8220;Ore wa Yojinbo&#8221; (1967, NET channels) and &#8220;Shinsen-gumi&#8221; (1973, CS channels) &#8220;Shinsen-gumi&#8221; (1987, TV Asahi) SERIZAWA was played by Takeo CHII. SERIZAWA was basically portrayed as a villain, but also as a man of consequence. The drama was broadcast over 2 consecutive nights, and SERIZAWA was the main enemy in the drama for the first night. Although he continued to act atrociously for transient pleasures he was portrayed as a man with unexplainable charm. Other men of Mito Group were shown simply as yakuza-like villains. TV drama, &#8220;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&#8221; (1988) (1988, TV Asahi) SERIZAWA was played by Chiharu MATSUYAMA. SERIZAWA was shown as a villain but a person with charm. His assassination scene was shown with historically accurate details; he was attacked in his sleep wearing his loincloth only, and he was slashed into pieces almost without being able to fight back. Other men of Mito Group were played by actors with large build and sinister looks, and they seemed more like bandits rather than yakuzas. Masataka IWAO, who played the part of Nishiki NIIMI, SERIZAWA&#8217;s right-hand man, is a tough-looking giant man, and is closer to SERIZAWA&#8217;s image than slender MATSUYAMA. Shinsengumi! (2004, Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Taiga Drama) SERIZAWA was played by Koichi SATO. He was portrayed not as a villain but as a man who pretended to be a villain; he was also portrayed as an educated and popular man of consequence in addition to being a good swordsman. He was portrayed as a wall which the main character, Isami KONDO (played by Shingo KATORI) had to overcome, and he was an important character supporting the first half of the drama. The scriptwriter, Koki MITANI, said that he aimed for &#8220;the best villain ever in the history of Taiga Drama,&#8221; and on appreciation of good acting by SATO, he increased the number of episodes in which SERIZAWA appeared. In the scene of his assassination, SERIZAWA, realizing everything, waited for HIJIKATA, OKITA, YAMANAMI, and HARADA to come, and a large-scale sword fight was performed against the 4 men. This drama is rare because other men of Mito Group were portrayed not just as just villains but with individual details and personalities. Wachigai-ya Itosato (2007, TBS) SERIZAWA was played by Shido NAKAMURA. In this drama, [the scriptwriter lets] SERIZAWA say that there is a reason for each one of his many actions; these actions result in the description of him as a man of violent and broad-minded personality. Although SERIZAWA, together with Nishiki NIIMI, treated Shieikan Group as if they were &#8220;rustic,&#8221; there was only little animosity between the Shieikan Group and Mito Group. Also, regarding his lover Oume, it is described that she was deserted by the owner of Hishi-ya Store, became reckless, and ended up in bed with SERIZAWA at that hour [that he was assassinated]. This drama is based on a novel by Jiro ASADA of the same title. Other works Movies Hono-no Gotoku/Flames of Blood (1981, leading role played by Bunta SUGAWARA), SERIZAWA was played by Nobuo KAWAI. TV drama Shinsengumi Shimatsuki (1977, leading role played by Mikijiro HIRA), SERIZAWA was played by Hideo TAKAMATSU.

He was a member of roshi-gumi (an organization of masterless samurai).<br></p><p>He was born the child of a statesman of the Yuki clan, Chuemon TSUCHIYA, a wealthy farmer of Tonouchi village (present-day Sanbu-gun, Chiba Prefecture). He dedicated himself to studying at Shoheizaka Gakumonjo (Shoheizaka School) (corresponds to present day Tokyo University) in Edo (present-day Tokyo). It is believed that he was sturdy and strong, and was excellent in martial arts. In 1863, he joined the roshi-gumi founded by Hachiro KIYOKAWA, and was granted the title of superintendent officer, but was demoted for his failures. When they reached Kyo (present-day Kyoto) to hatch a plan, Kiyokawa tried to return to Edo to expell foreigners from Japan together with roshi-gumi.

He was a member of roshi-gumi (an organization of masterless samurai). He was born the child of a statesman of the Yuki clan, Chuemon TSUCHIYA, a wealthy farmer of Tonouchi village (present-day Sanbu-gun, Chiba Prefecture). He dedicated himself to studying at Shoheizaka Gakumonjo (Shoheizaka School) (corresponds to present day Tokyo University) in Edo (present-day Tokyo). It is believed that he was sturdy and strong, and was excellent in martial arts. In 1863, he joined the roshi-gumi founded by Hachiro KIYOKAWA, and was granted the title of superintendent officer, but was demoted for his failures. When they reached Kyo (present-day Kyoto) to hatch a plan, Kiyokawa tried to return to Edo to expell foreigners from Japan together with roshi-gumi. Many members agreed with Kiyokawa, and accompanied him. Apart from Kiyokawa&#8217;s movement, he was assigned by Kyuo UDONO to person responsible for organizing the remaining members of roshi-gumi in Mibu village together with Tsuguo IESATO. (Tonouchi and Iesato were not listed as they were the responsible persons on the recruiting side.) The members from the Mito clan; Kamo SERIZAWA, Nishiki NIIMI (Iori TANAKA), Jusuke HIRAMA, Goro HIRAYAMA, Shingoro KASUYA, Jusuke HIRAMA, Kenji NOGUCHI, the members from Shieikan training hall; ABIRU, Isami KONDO, Keisuke YAMANAMI, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Shinpachi NAGAKURA, Sanosuke HARADA, Soji OKITA, the members who joined in Kyoto including Genzaburo INOUE, Hajime SAITO and Matasaburo SAEKI, and NEGISHI force including Yuzan NEGISHI and Goichi SHIMIZU came together. He was the top warrior of Mibu-Roshi (Mibu masterless warriors group), but there are few references and traditions concerning him, most likely due to the fact that he was violently hated by Isami KONDO (There still remains a document which says that Kondo killed Tonouchi out of this hatred). It is said that Kondo, Serizawa, Negishi had already organized their respective factions, but Tonouchi and Iesato didn&#8217;t have any factions (probably, they never imagined that so many warriors would be purged in the future) as they became the top warriors who had the confidence of Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and were close to Negishi. Just before Tonouchi left Kyoto to organize his own faction, Kondo offered him a sizeable amount of Sake. After that, he was attacked by surprise, and died on Shijio-ohashi Bridge in Kyoto (It is believed that he was attacked by Isami KONDO and Soji OKITA, and was killed by Okita). Tonouchi was killed while wearing clothes and having belongings fit for travel; his sword was kept in a bag. Various reasons abound as to the reason behind the feud between Tonouchi and Kondo including: Tonouchi&#8217;s less than fine character; he was the first person who was killed as a result of Kondo&#8217;s ambition; it was a purge carried out by the Serizawa faction. If Tonouchi had not been killed and had been available, Shinsengumi would have been a different group during the end of the Edo period. (Apart from the presence of his ability for leadership and no matter whether it was good or bad, Kondo also purged Serizawa, and made the group develop close to the Aizu clan.) Tonouchi&#8217;s murder was described in a picture. Iesato who lost Tonouchi left Kyoto for Osaka, and he was captured and purged while recruiting a member. Negishi left Mibu village to worship Ise-jingu Shrine just after Tonouchi died. (Thereafter, Negishi lived until the age of seventy something while being a part of the Shinsengumi.)

He was from Mito Domain. He was the leader of Shinsengumi and demoted to the vice chief later. He was also called Kinzan. When he borrowed money from Gohe HIRANOYA in Osaka to make Shinsengumi&#8217;s haori (Japanese half-coat), he signed his name as &#35242;&#35211;&#37670; (Shinmi SHINMI) as a leader in apposition with Kondo and Sesizawa. Considering the signature, it is possible that his name &#26032;&#35211;&#37670; is read Shinmi NISHIKI. Biography He learned swordsmanship from Sukeyemon Okada and was conferred Menkyo-kaiden (full proficiency) of the Shindo-Munen school. In March, 1863, Hachiro KIYOKAWA became a member of Roshigumi which was organized to protect Iemochi TOKUGAWA, the seii taishogun (great general) when Iemochi went to Kyoto by a suggestion. He became the head of the Sanbangumi (the 3rd group). Also Kamo SERIZAWA from Mito and Isami KONDO from Edo Shieikan (a training hall of swordplay) of Tennenrishin-ryu shool, who organized Shinsengumi later, became the members. The previous history of Niimi is unclear, but considering the fact that he was appointed the head of a group, it is assumed that he was well-known. It seems that Niimi was an old comrade of Kamo SERIZAWA, the head of the Rokubangumi (the sixth group) who were also from Mito, but it is unknown how they were related to each other. Also Niimi&#8217;s swordsmanship master, Sukeyemon Okada participated in it as the organizer of the Gobangumi (the fifth group). Five disciples of the Tama group of Tennenrishin-ryu including Genzaburo INOUE, Rintaro OKITA (brother-in-law of Soji OKITA) and others were assigned to Niimi in his group (those members didn&#8217;t participate in Shinsengumi except Inoue). Niimi left Edo on March 26 and arrived at Kyoto on April 10. He stayed at the residence of Kamejiro NANBU with Shingoro KASUYA (from Mito). Serizawa stayed at the residence of Gennojo YAGI with Kondo and according to the recollection of the son of the Yagi family Tamesaburo YAGI, Niimi and Kasuya spent a lot of time at the house of Yagi family where Serizawa stayed. On April 14, after Kiyokawa revealed his true intention to expel foreigners and go back to Edo, Serizawa and Kondo expressed their intention to stay in Kyoto and left the group. Those who left the group were 5 Mito roshis (masterless samurai) including Serizawa, Niimi and 8 disciples of Shieikan including Kondo, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Keisuke YAMANAMI, Soji OKITA and also some other people including Yoshio TONOUCHI, Yuzan NEGISHI, Shingoro KASUYA joined them, but they had an internal conflict soon, by which Tonouchi, Negishi, Kasuya and others were murdered or left the group. Consequently, those roshis were divided into two groups &#8211; the Mitoha group including Serizawa and Niimi, and the Shieikanha group including Hijikata. They submitted a petition to the lord of Aizu clan, Katamori MATSUDAIRA who was the Kyoto shugoshoku (Military governor of Kyoto), by which the Aizu clan had the custody of them and they took a name Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group). At the start of the group, Serizawa was assigned to the head as well as Kondo. In the note which they wrote when they borrowed 100 ryo (currency unit) from a merchant in Osaka City (by force) in May, there are names of Niimi, Serizawa and Kondo. When the group was reorganized in July due to the increasing number of members, Niimi was demoted from the leader to the vice commander. Though it seemed that Niimi was Serizawa&#8217;s right arm acting with him together, Niimi didn&#8217;t participate in the group at the Osaka wrestlers brawl incident and the Yamatoya fire attack incident which Serizawa caused, therefore it is unknown how close they were to each other who were both the senior leaders and from Mito, and also how they acted actually as the leaders of Mibu-Roshigumi. Tamesaburo YAGI who remembered Serizawa and Kondo well, didn&#8217;t remember Niimi at all and said that Niimi disappeared without his noticing it. Therefore it is sometimes considered that Niimi was less represented, but seeing the record that he neglected his duties for the group, it is assumed that he rarely appeared at Yagi family&#8217;s house as the headquarters, and did not meet Tamesaburo. At the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), Niimi went into action with Serizawa and Kondo, and fought as rear guard. Using this occasion, Mibu-Roshigumi changed its mane to Shinsengumi. According to &#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokokukiji&#8221; written by Shinpachi NAGAKURA who was one of the Shinsengumi leaders, Niimi often exhibited disorderly behaviors and broke laws, not listening to convictions of Serizawa and Kondo. Also according to &#8220;Shinsen-gumi Shimatsuki&#8221; written by Kan SHIMOZAWA, Niimie gave himself over to a life of debauchery and neglected his duties and repeatedly extorted money from citizens in the name of corps&#8217; expense. On October 25, Niimi was forced to commit seppuku. According to &#8220;Shinsen-gumi Shimatsuki,&#8221; a lot of his evil deeds were disclosed and he was pressed to commit seppuku or accept decapitation according to the law, and finally he was forced to commit seppuku at fancy Japanese-style restaurant Yama no O in Gion Shinchi where he enjoyed himself. According to &#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokokukiji,&#8221; his seppuku was decided by discussion of all concerned, but again he roughed up Tsunero YOSHINARI, a ronin(masterless samurai)from Mito at a lodging in Sanjo Kiyamachi, therefore he was forced to commit seppuku by the assistance of Nanigashi UMEZU, however the truth is unknown. According to &#8220;Roshi Bunkyu Hokokukiji,&#8221; it is dated on August 14, 15, which is also unclear. There is also a theory that he was forced to commit seppuku, not just because of his disorderly behaviours, but because of the close relation with the sonnojoi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) such as Mito Domain, Choshu Domain and Tosa Domain, because Niimi is enshrined in Kyoto Reizan Gokoku-jinja Shrine which was built to enshrine the tobakuha (anti-Bakufu, crushing-the-Bakufu faction) sonnojoi patriots in the Maiji period, though shinsengumi was the enemy of the tobakuha and Niimi was the leader. On October 28, only three days after Niimi&#8217;s death, Serizawa and Goro HIRAYAMA from the Mitoha group were attacked and murdered by the Shieikanha group, by which the Mitoha group of Shinsengumi was destroyed. Iori TANAKA There is a theory that a member of Shinsengumi Iori TANAKA and Nishiki NIIMI was the same person, but it is unclear. In recent years, there is another theory that a Mito roshi Kumetaro ARAYA (&#26032;&#23478;&#31874;&#22826;&#37070;) was Nishiki NIIMI. The grave of Iori TANAKA is in Mibu-dera Temple.

He was from the Himeji or Mito domain. He served in Shinsengumi, holding the office of assistant deputy leader (Some say that he was promoted to leader or deputy leader status after the demotion of Nishiki NIIMI). Biography Goro HIRAYAMA was a disciple of Fukutaro HORIKAWA (&#22528;&#24029;&#31119;&#22826;&#37070;), a former retainer of the feudal lord of the Himeji domain, and a full master in the Shindo-Munen-ryu school of swordsmanship. He lost his sight in one eye (his left eye) in a accident involving fireworks. It is said that he slashed back violently when being attacked from the left, (the side with his impaired eye), and was rather off guard when being attacked from the right (the side that should have functioned normally). There has been a record of his visit to the training hall of Rennosuke HAGIWARA, the master of the Jikishinkage-ryu school of swordsmanship, located in modern day Totsuka Ward, Yokohama City. In February 1863, he participated in Roshigumi, an organization formed at the suggestion of Hachiro KIYOKAWA. He was assigned to Rokubangumi, to which Kamo SERIZAWA belonged, and moved to Kyoto. When Kiyokawa schemed to have the Roshigumi return to Edo, he stayed in Kyoto with Serizawa, Isamu KONDO among others. Ronin who stayed in Kyoto came to be under the control of the Aizu domain, which was took on the duty of protecting Kyoto, and formed an organization called the Mibu-Roshigumi. Hirayama assumed the position of assistant deputy leader&#8211;a leadership role. The Mibu-Roshigumi were divided into two groups: the Mitoha group, to which Kamo SERIZAWA, Nishiki NIIMI, and others belonged; and, the Shieikanha group to which Toshizo HIJIKATA and others belonged. Hirayama belonged to the former and collaborated with Serizawa. When Mibu-Roshigumi had an audience with Katamori MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Aizu domain, in May, Hirayama displayed his swordsmanship prowess with Hijikata, Heisuke TODO, and others. On June 3, 10 ronin (Serizawa, Kondo, Keisuke YAMANAMI, Soji OKITA, Shinpachi NAGAKURA, Hajime SAITO, Kenji NOGUCHI, Genzaburo INOUE, Kai SHIMADA and Hirayama) went down to Osaka City, as it is known today, in order to clamp down on outlaw ronin. Saito became ill while they were sailing on the Yodogawa River, and they left their boat and made their way to the red-light district in Shinchi. On their way, they beat down a sumo wrestler who was rude to them (some say Serizawa used his sword to slay the sumo wrestler without a second thought). After the ronin entered the red-light district, friends of the sumo wrestler came to exact revenge, and a fight broke out. The sumo wrestlers used wooden clubs to attack the ronin, but the ronin drove them back killing and injurying many of the sumo wrestlers in the process. None of the ronin were killed; but Hirayama was injured from a blow to the chest. On August 12, Serizawa committed an outrageous act of destruction&#8211;he set fire to the Yamatoya building, a silk wholesaler. On the occasion of the August 18 Coup d\\'etat, the Mibu-Roshigumi was mobilized and renamed the Shinsengumi. In late August, a burglar carrying a gun broke into a rice store at Shijo-Horikawa, and five members of the Shinsengumi (Nagakura, Saito, Hirayama and Yasohachi YAMANO) were sent after him. When the burglar attempted to shoot them, they drew their swords and killed him. Hirayama was injured. In September, when a geisha named Kotora did not obey Serizawa, he became angry and rampaged through the Yoshidaya geisha house. Nagakura, Saito, Hijikata and Hirayama who accompanied Serizawa, intimidated the master and insulted Kotora and Oshika, a geisha attending to Kotora, by cutting their hair. Obeying the orders of Serizawa, Hijikata cut Kotora&#8217;s hair and Hirayama cut Oshika&#8217;s hair. Around that time, the Aizu domain secretly ordered Kondo, Hijikata, Yamanami and others to punish Serizawa. This was a response to the Imperial Court&#8217;s order to arrest Serizawa for his violent behavior. On September 16 (September 18, according to another account), Serizawa, Hirayama and Jusuke HIRAMA (Serizawa&#8217;s disciple who held the office of assistant deputy leader) attended a party at Sumiya in Shimabara, and came back to the residence of the Yagi Family, where they quartered. Hirayama was too drunk to standup at the entrance. Their mistresses were waiting for them at the residence of the Yagi Family. Hirayama fell asleep with Kichiei, a geisha who belonged to a geisha house named Kikyoya and had been a long-time intimate partner with Hirayama, in a ten-mat room located in the inner part of the residence. In the same room, but divided by a folding screen, Serizawa and his mistress Oume were sleeping on the other side. In the middle of the night, several men burst into the room and slashed at Serizawa and Hirayama with swords. Hirayama was killed instantly. Serizawa tried to get up and escape, but he fell and was hacked to death. Oume was also mercilessly killed. Kichiei, who was sleeping with Hirayama, escaped with her life. It is said that she had gone to the toilet when the attack occured. Hirama, who was in another room, escaped. In the room, after the assassins left, the Yagi family made the grizzly discovery of a bloody pool in which Hirayama&#8217;s decapitated head and body lied. Hirayama was 35 years old. Officially, this execution was an act of the Choshu domain, but the assassins are said to have been Toshizo HIJIKATA, Keisuke YAMANAMI, Soji OKITA and Sanosuke HARADA.

Biography The name Oume can be seen in &#8220;Roshi (masterless samurai) Bunkyu Era Patriotism Articles&#8221; and &#8220;Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki&#8221; as a favorite concubine of Kamo SERIZAWA, who was the head of Shinsengumi. Oume&#8217;s upbringing and how she met Serizawa can be found in detail in &#8220;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&#8221; and &#8220;Shinsengumi Ibun,&#8221; which are narratives written in the Showa period by a novelist, Kan SHIMOZAWA, based on his interviews with Tamesaburo YAGI (a son of the Yagi family whose residence was used as Shinsengumi headquarters). According to Tamesaburo&#8217;s testimony, it is said that Oume was born in Nishijin, Kyoto, and she stayed at an ochaya (tea house where guests are entertained by geisha) in Shimabara. Later, she became a mistress of Tahee HISHIYA, a kimono fabrics dealer. She was about 22 or 23 years old. Serizawa shopped at Hishiya&#8217;s store but he did not make any payments. Hishiya sent his clerk to the headquarters but Serizawa would not make his payment. Since he was a brute and was feared as Miburo (wolf of Mibu) by the people of Kyoto, one would not know what he would do if he was repeatedly asked to make his payment. Therefore, Hishiya sent Oume to ask for the payment, thinking that a woman might solicit a softer response. Oume was a fine and charming woman, and she was so beautiful that the she became popular among the Shinsengumi members. Serizawa shooed her away 2 or 3 times, but one day, he took Oume, who came to ask for the payment, into a room and had a physical relationship with her. As unpredictable as a woman could be, Oume, who was reluctant at first, soon went to see Serizawa willingly. At the time, there was a power struggle between Serizawa of Mito Group and Isami KONDO of Shieikan Group within the Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group). On October 30, 1863, Shinsengumi had a party with the geisha girls at Sumiya in Shimabara. Prior to the evening of that day, Oume came to the Yagi family&#8217;s house. Soon Itozato, a geisha girl from Wachigaiya, who was acquainted with Jusuke HIRAMA of Mito Group, and Kichiei KIKYOYA, who was a friend of Goro HIRAYAMA, also came. Since Serizawa was not home Oume was chatting with her close friends, such as Kichiei and the housemaids of the Yagi family, in the kitchen. Serizawa, Hirayama, Hirama and the vice chief, Toshizo HIJIKATA (Shieikan Group), came back at night. They invited Oume and the others and continued with the party, and Hijikata got Serizawa and others completely drunk. Serizawa, completely drunk, fell asleep with Oume in the ten tatami-mat room in the back. Setting up a paper folding screen, Hirayama also fell asleep with Kichiei. Hirama and Itozato slept in a room by the entrance. It was raining heavily that night. Late at night, several men broke into the room where Serizawa and others were sleeping. They killed Hirayama, and as soon as Serizawa was attacked with a sword he stood up and jumped naked into the next room, where the Yagi family members were sleeping, but he was slashed to death several times on the spot. The assassins left as soon as they killed Serizawa and Hirayama. When Tamesaburo and others came to Serizawa&#8217;s room to see what was going on, there was a pool of blood inside, Hirayama&#8217;s head was severed from his body, and Oume, who was sleeping with Serizawa, lay covered in blood, wearing only her yumoji and almost totally naked (it is not that she had a sexual relationship with Serizawa that night, and it is said that because Serizawa, being completely drunk, complained of being cold, so she put her dress over him and tried to warm him with her body. On the night of this incident, it had been raining since daytime, and the temperature was low). Oume&#8217;s corpse was such that her head was cut off and it was barely connected to the body by a piece of skin. Hirama, who was in a separate room, fled. Kichiei and Itozato also disappeared. The Choshu clan was said to be responsible, but the more prominent theory says that the assassins that night were Toshizo HIJIKATA, Keisuke YAMANAMI, Soji OKITA and Sanosuke HARADA of Shieikan Group. Shinsengumi claimed the bodies of top-ranking members, Serizawa and Hirayama, but nobody came to claim Oume&#8217;s body. There was a suggestion to bury her together with Serizawa because she was a special person to him, but Kondo strongly opposed saying that he could not bury Serizawa, who was the leader, with a prostitute like Oume. A funeral for Serizawa and Hirayama took place according to Shinto rites on November 1, and Kondo read a gracious funeral speech. Oume&#8217;s body was left at the Yagi family&#8217;s house, but since it was summer it could not have been left for a long time, and even though they negotiated with Hishiya, who was Oume&#8217;s host, he would not take responsibility, saying &#8216;I gave her a leave.&#8217; It is said that the members of the Yagi family, not knowing what else to do, made every effort to get Oume&#8217;s family in Nishijin to claim her body, and it is also said that she was buried as a muen botoke (a person who died leaving nobody to look after her grave).

It is said that he was from Choshu Domain or Edo. It is said that he participated in Mibu-Roshi (Mibu masterless warriors group) with Hajime SAITO. In front of Katamori MATSUDAIRA, the Kyoto shugoshoku (Military governor of Kyoto), he showed swordsmanship match with Goro Hirayama. He was acting together with the Serizawa group. In Kyoto Shimabara, he was murdered by someone. The mystery of Saeki The spy theory His origin was unknown and he was a spy sent by the Choshu Domain or the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). Therefore he and Saito who participated in the group around the same time, spied dividing into each side. The death of Saeki Serizawa killed him. His spy operation was found out. He stole Serizawa&#8217;s possession. It is because Saeki killed Aijiro SASAKI. Also Saeki raped Aguri, a concubine of Aijiro, therefore he was killed by Serizawa who wanted Aguri. Niimi killed him. Because Saeki was looking for the fact that Niimi was a spy of Choshu, he was lured and killed by Niimi. Feudal retainers of Choshu Domain killed him. In Shimabara he was tangled and tortured to death by some feudal retainers of Choshu Domain. He failed his spy operation or his double operation was found out. Originally he infiltrated Shinsengumi serving under Genzui KUSAKA, but Saeki neglected his duty to give information to Kusaka and placed himself in Shinsengumi for real, therefore he was killed by Kusaka. The mystery of his origin The Choshu theory The Edo theory It is almost impossible to solve the mystery of Saeki because there are not so many relevant documents and stories of witnesses from that period. Fiction In the historical drama of 2004 &#8220;Shinsengumi!&#8221; he appeared as a servant of the Yagi family where Mibu-Roshi was based. He volunteered to participate in Mibu-Roshigumi and while he was trying to gain the favor of the leader Kamo SERIAWA, he threw his weight about among people of lower positions, which amazed people around him. However, he was longing to be a samurai more than others and making efforts to be successful, while he saved money to purchase a fine sword secretly.

He was from Tsushima Domain. \\n He was studied the Hokushin-Ittoryu Kobudo school of swordsmanship under Eijiro CHIBA (Eijiro Nariyuki CHIBA) who was the second son of Shusaku CHIBA, and He joined a group of masterless warrior in February 1863, and travelled to Kyoto. He became a member of the Tonouchi-Iesato group (i.e., the group led by Yoshio TONOUCHI and Tsuguo IESATO). After the group decided to return to Edo, they remained behind in Kyoto with Isami KONDO, Kamo SERIZAWA and others. He was one of twenty-four members of the Mibu masterless warriors group at the time of its formation. While active in the group he worked together with Kondo and associates. He died on April 6, 1863. It is thought that he was either murdered, or died of disease. An alternative version maintains that he died on March 25. Fiction Although he is not often made the subject of dramatic depictions and the like, due to its humble status, he did appear in the NHK Historical drama &#8220;Shinsengumi!&#8221; (his role was played by Taro YABE, of comedy duo Karateka). He fell ill and was unable to return to Edo due to weakness, so he joined the masterless warriors group by default. One night while he was having a coughing fit in the hallway, he reported to Isami Kondo that he had witnessed from the window a member of the masterless warriors group named Yoshio TONOUCHI make contact with a member of the Tadasaburo SASAKI group. That served as the basis for the assassination of Yoshio Tonouchi. Because of these developments, the Mibu masterless warriors group became fractured, whereupon Toshizo HIJIKATA is said to have made Kondo stand up and bear verbal abuse in relation to the demise of Tonouchi, offering his condolences, and expressing his resolve to play a more active role. As a result, Abiru&#8217;s report indirectly determined that the direction taken by the Mibu masterless warriors group to come under the guiding influence of the way of life of Hijikata. In the end, he turned to his kin in Otsu for support, saying farewell to Kondo and the others, and leaving the group. There is no description of his subsequent activities or his death.

He was one of the Matsushiro Sanzan (the collective name of confusian scholars in Matsushiro Domain at the end of Edo Period). His was commonly called Shuri, and his real name was Kunitada, later Hiraki, and pseudonym was Shiteki, later Shimei. He was posthumously granted Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank). Biography On March 22, 1811, he was born as the first son of Ichigaku SAKUMA, a clansman in Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province. It is said that his pen name, Shozan, originated from a Zen temple Zozanemyo of the Obaku sect in the neighborhood. Shozan came from a low-ranking warrior family in Matsushiro Domain, and studied Keigaku (study of Keisho in Confucianism) and mathematics in his youth. He was especially interested in mathematics and studied it hard. The mathematical knowledge he learned in his youth was of great advantage to him in Western studies later. In 1833, he went to Edo and studied Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism) under Issai SATO, the leading authority on Confucianism in those days, and became collectively to be known as &#8216;Niketsu&#8217; (two masters) with Hokoku YAMADA. Shozan was basically no more than a \\'traditional intellectual&#8217; in those days, while he began to recognize the Western countries. In 1839, he ran a private school \\'Shozan Shoin&#8217; in Edo and taught Confucianism. In 1842, when Yukitsura SANADA, the lord of Matsushiro Domain, whom Shozan served, was appointed Kaibo gakari (coastal defense) concurrently with Roju (member of shogun&#8217;s council of elders), circumstances turned 180 degrees for Shozan. The lord Yukitsura singled out Shozan to be the person in charge of Western studies, and Shozan began studying military science under Hidetatsu (also known as Tarozaemon) EGAWA. Gentle and thoughtful Egawa seemed to dislike Shozan, but Shozan managed to learn military science from Egawa and wrote and submitted \\'Kaibo Hassaku&#8217; (eight measures for naval defense) to the lord Yukitsura and was highly estimated. Shozan did great service as he succeeded in casting a cannon by absorbing techniques from Egawa and Shuhan TAKASHIMA. Thereafter, Shozan took a great interest in Western studies as well as military science. He succeeded in making glass, inventing an earthquake prediction device, and furthermore, he planned to introduce vaccination for Cowpox virus. When Mathew Perry&#8217;s Ships entered the harbor of Uraga in 1853, Shozan went to Uraga for inspection. When Perry&#8217;s squadron arrived again in 1854, his disciple Shoin YOSHIDA attempted to stow away and failed. Shozan was implicated in the incident and incarcerated in Tenmacho prison, and besides, he was placed under house arrest in Matsushiro after the imprisonment until 1862. In 1864, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA invited him to Kyoto where he taught Yoshinobu Kobugatai-ron (theory of reconciliation between the Imperial court and the shogunate) and Kaikoku-ron (theory of opening of a country to the world). Going to Kyoto, which in those days was the place where most of the Imperialists under the slogan of \\'Sonno Joi ha&#8217; (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) hid themselves, was dangerous for Shozan, who gave the impression of being a \\'Westernized&#8217; person in those days, (he even walked in Kyoto without any attendants). On September 11, he was assassinated by Iemon MAEDA and Gensai KAWAKAMI. He died at the age of 54. A memorial monument for the incident is placed at the site of assassination. Personal Profile and Episodes Shozan was a slightly overconfident and arrogant person, which was the reason he had a lot of enemies. Some people say that largely because of his personality, he has not been well-evaluated in spite of his various achievements. Nevertheless, Shozan was undoubtedly a recognized authority on Western studies in Japan in those days. That can be seen from the story of Gensai KAWAKAMI., who killed Shozan with his sword but due to the shock he received at learning Shozan&#8217;s personal history, never assassinated again. Moreover, his disciples include not only the above-mentioned Yoshida but also Torasaburo KOBAYASHI, Kaishu KATSU, Tsugunosuke KAWAI, Ryoma SAKAMOTO, Sanai HASHIMOTO, and Hiroyuki KATO, all of whom led Japan in later days; that shows, in fact, that Shozan had a great influence on the upheaval of Japan during the end of Edo period. Shozan considered himself to be \\'the property of Japan,&#8217; so he asked to Ryoma SAKAMOTO, &#8220;Introduce me to a woman with large buttocks who can give birth to a lot of children because my child by blood is destined to achieve great things.&#8221; But his son Keinosuke MIURA had dubious morals the same as his father, and deserted the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto at the end of Edo period) instead of achieving great things. Whether it was true or not, it is said that Shozan was the only Japanese Mathew Perry bowed to. Although Kaishu KATSU became an older step-brother of Shozan through the marriage of Kaishu&#8217;s younger sister and Shozan in 1852, Kaishu did not greatly appreciated Shozan as Shozan was arrogant. \\n According to Hikawa SEIWA, Kaishu disparaged Shozan such as \\'He was just as people said he was, a very thoughtless and restless man, but he was helped by the age he lived in.&#8217; \\nIt seems that Kaishu and Shozan did not get along with each other as both of them were overconfident. Shozan was good at composing waka poems and Chinese poems, and paintings and calligraphic works. According to &#8220;Edo-jidai no Kinji Monogatari&#8221; (the Tales of Koto [a traditional Japanese string instrument] Players in the Edo Period) written by Shigeo KISHIBE, Shozan played the kokin (seven-string koto) and the koto for pleasure. He carried out a military exercise of cannon shooting in 1851, but the barrel of a cannon exploded and he was laughed at. \\n Yet, Shozan remained calm and said \\'Because of a failure, we can succeed.&#8217; (Source: shinsengumi-archives.github.io ) \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n sakuma shozan bio wiki corpus \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n '", "title": "Shozan SAKUMA (\u4f50\u4e45\u9593\u8c61\u5c71) [wiki-corpus]", "url": "https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188617760966/shozan-sakuma-%E4%BD%90%E4%B9%85%E9%96%93%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%B1-wiki-corpus"}, "188618936211": {"html": "b'<div id=\"post-188618936211\" class=\"post post-type-text\">\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-meta\">\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"type\">\\r\\n                                <a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188618936211/hachiro-kiyokawa-%E6%B8%85%E6%B2%B3%E5%85%AB%E9%83%8E-wiki-corpus\">Text</a>\\r\\n                            </div>--><!-- .type -->\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        </div><!-- .post-meta -->\\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-content\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<!-- .date -->\\r\\n                        <!--\\r\\n                            <div class=\"date\">\\r\\n                                October 26, 2019\\r\\n                            </div>\\r\\n                        -->\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        <div class=\"post-text\">\\r\\n                        \\r\\n                        \\r\\n                            <h3 class=\"post-title\"><a href=\"https://shinsengumi-archives.tumblr.com/post/188618936211/hachiro-kiyokawa-%E6%B8%85%E6%B2%B3%E5%85%AB%E9%83%8E-wiki-corpus\">Hachiro KIYOKAWA (&#28165;&#27827;&#20843;&#37070;) [wiki-corpus]</a></h3>\\r\\n                            <p>Hachiro KIYOKAWA (October 10th, first year of Tenpo (Lunar Calendar)(November 24, 1830) - April 13th, third year of Bunkyu (Lunar Calendar)(May 30, 1863)) was a Shishi at end of Edo Period, and one of the leaders of the Roshigumi. He was child of Hidetoshi SAITO, a Samurai living in Kiyokawa Village, Shonai-han, Dewa Province (present day Shonai-machi, Higashitagawa District, Yamagata Prefecture). His childhood name was Motoshi. Imina was Masaaki. His real name was Masaaki SAITO. </p><h3>His Life</h3><p>In 1843, Hachiro studied hard under Yasuemon HATAKEDA, a public officer of Kiyokawa Barrier. He seems to have been an excellent student. In the third year of Koka, he met Tesseki FUJIMOTO, the leader of Tenchu-gumi, and deepened friendship with him. In 1847, he came to Edo and studied under Ichido TOJO of Kogaku Sect.

He was child of Hidetoshi SAITO, a Samurai living in Kiyokawa Village, Shonai-han, Dewa Province (present day Shonai-machi, Higashitagawa District, Yamagata Prefecture). His childhood name was Motoshi. Imina was Masaaki. His real name was Masaaki SAITO. His Life In 1843, Hachiro studied hard under Yasuemon HATAKEDA, a public officer of Kiyokawa Barrier. He seems to have been an excellent student. In the third year of Koka, he met Tesseki FUJIMOTO, the leader of Tenchu-gumi, and deepened friendship with him. In 1847, he came to Edo and studied under Ichido TOJO of Kogaku Sect. He was acknowledged for his abilities and was ordered to become the Head of Tojo Juku, but he firmly declined to assume the position. He was transferred to the Juku of Gonzai ASAKA. At the same time, he practiced and mastered swardsmanship at Genbukan under Shusaku CHIBA, the founder of Hokushin Itto Ryu; he also studied at Shoheiko School of Edo Shogunate. Subsequently, he established Kiyokawa juku. \\n (In the city of Edo, Kiyokawa juku was the only juku where one person taught both academic learning and swordsmanship.) Between March and September of 1855, he left Kiyokawa Village with his mother. They traveled widely visiting Zenko-ji Temple, Nagoya, Ise, Nara, Kyoto, Omi, Osaka, Miyajima, Iwakuni, Amanohashidate, Kamakura, Edo, Nikko and so on. The record of this trip, &#8220;Saiyuso&#8221; is a valuable material for learning about travel conditions at the end of Edo period. It mainly describes meetings with noted persons of various provinces, but perhaps because of KIYOKAWA&#8217;s character, he wrote many bitter and severe criticisms [in the report]. After being deeply shocked by the Sakurada Gate Incident which occurred in 1860 his ideology shifted towards overthrowing of the Tokugawa Shogunate and of Sonno joi. After this incident, many patriots started to gather in Kiyokawa juku. In 1863, Kobi no Kai was formed, with Hachiro as the Leader. The people who started this gathering were Tesshu YAMAOKA and 15 others. They planned to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate by attacking and setting fire to Yokohama Foreign Settlement, thereby stirring up the spirit of Sonno joi, but this secret plan became known by the Tokuwa Shogunate. Furthermore, as they slashed a person who berated Hachiro, they were now pursued by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Due to such circumstances, Hachiro lived in hiding in Kyoto, and he also campaigned in various provinces in the east and the west in order to obtain private agreements for Sonno joi and overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate. He subsequently submitted a letter of his opinion to Shungaku MATSUDAIRA (Leader of Political Affairs of the Tokugawa Shogunate) regarding the Three Urgent Measures to be Taken (1. Carrying out joi, 2. Issuing amnesty, 3. Educating talented persons of the nation.) \\nThe Shogunate, who had problems managing Sonno joi Shishi&#8217;s, adopted his opinion. The Roshigumi was formed (234 men). Hachiro succeeded in outwitting the Shogunate. On February 23 1863, when Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA traveled to Kyoto Hachiro accompanied him as the leader of Roshigumi who served as the vanguard for the Shogun. On the night they arrived in Kyoto, Hachiro gathered his group of Roshi at Shintoku-ji Temple in Mibu and stated that their real purpose was not to guard the Shogun but to be the vanguard of Sonno joi. \\n Isami KONDO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Kamo SERIZAWA and others objected to this (Kyuo UDONO requested two members of the Roshigumi, Yoshio TONOUCHI and Tsuguo IESATO, to coordinate those who desired to remain in Kyoto; Yuzan NEGISHI, Kamo SERIZAWA and Isami KONDO and others remained in Kyoto to take a path separate from that of Hachiro, and they became Mibu warriors who later developed into Shinsengumi.) \\nHachiro, who was given his own force of 200 men, requested to the Imperial Government to be allowed to submit a Petition, which was fortunately accepted. The Shogunate became anxious about such unstable state of affairs of Roshigumi, and made the Roshigumi return to Edo. Hachiro tried to mobilize the Roshigumi after he returned to Edo, but his life was in danger as he had been completely against the Shogunate in Kyoto. On April 13th of the 3rd Year of Bunkyu, Hachiro was attacked by 6 assassins of the Shogunate, including Tadasaburo SASAKI and Shigeaki KUBOTA, at Azabu Ichinohashi, and was beheaded. He died at the age of 34. According to Joshido, his head was retrieved by Shuzo ISHIZAKA and was kept by Fusako YAMAOKA (the wife of Tesshu YAMAOKA), who returned it to Hachiro&#8217;s family. After Hachiro&#8217;s death, the Shogunate changed the name of the Roshigumi to Shinsengumi, and placed it under the supervision of Shonai-han.

Member of Shinsengumi (Shoshitoriatsukaiyaku and Kansatsu (Shinsengumi&#8217;s organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control), grand master of swordsman). \\n Hokushin-Ittoryu (school of swordsmanship), Shinto-ryu (school of swordsmanship) \\nWas his real name Gontaro KAMURA? Biography He was born as the second son of a low-level samurai of the Morioka domain. He threw himself into learning and swordsmanship and, in the Morioka domain, he entered a school for Kashima-Shinto-ryu school and distinguished himself. In 1863, he was allowed to go to Edo and entered Genbukan, which was a school for Hokushin-Ittoryu. At that time, the dojo (hall used for martial arts training) was a place to discuss affairs of state, and it seems that YOSHIMURA gradually devoted himself to antiforeign imperialism.. In 1865, he left the Morioka domain. As YOSHIMURA was poor and worried about his five family members and he joined Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) which was famous for its bravery. He had talent in both literature and military arts and was appreciated for this and was selected for Shoshi toriatsukaiyaku ken kansatsu (Shinsengumi&#8217;s organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control) and also was the grand master of Gekken martial art. In 1867, Shinsengumi was appointed to the vassal of Shogun and YOSHIMURA was given the similar status of Mimawarigumi (Tokugawa sided faction that fought during the Meiji Revolution). It is told that, on this occasion, he burst into tears of emotion that he could make sufficient remittances to his family back in his home town. Although he assumed the position of the grand master of Gekken martial art, there are few records of his actual fighting with swords. He visited Nishi Hongan-ji Temple to negotiate with respect to move of tonsho (headquarters) and attended the kyoo (banquet) by the Tosa domain for the purpose of apologizing for the Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Notice board Incident. There is no record of YOSHIMURA&#8217;s involvement in fighting with swords when he worked as a guard for Kyutaro MIURA in the Tenmaya Incident. It seems that he rather acted as a disputant. In January 1868, he took part in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi. After that, his whereabouts are untraceable whether he died in the battle or fled. According to Kan SHIMOZAWA, YOSHIMURA found that Shinsengumi left Osaka, became homeless and requested the Morioka hantei (mansion maintained by the Morioka domain) for permission for him to return to the Morioka domain. However, he was condemned by Jirouemon ONO, who was sahaiyaku (general manager) and ordered him to commit suicide by harakiri, and he died in the Morioka hantei by harakiri. It is told that in the room, in which he carried out harakiri, ten nibukin coins and a piece of paper were left and, on the paper, a sentence to ask remittance to be sent to his family was written. However, it is already ascertained that the person with the name of Jirouemon ONO was a fictitious person and, therefore, there is strong possibility that YOSHIMURA&#8217;s last was fiction by Kan SHIMOZAWA. Reportedly, in the family register of deaths of his descendants, the Yoshimura family, it is written that he died on February 15, 1870. Kanichiro YOSHIMU in the media Many of the above-mentioned legends of YOSHIMURA are fabrications by a novelist, Kan SHIMOZAWA. A historical novel, &#8220;Mibu Gishiden,&#8221; by Jiro ASADA was written based on the SHIMOZAWA&#8217;s fabrication. In 2002, it was broadcasted as a long-time (ten hours) TV drama (Starring: Ken WATANABE) by TV TOKYO Corporation. In the next year, 2003, it was made into a movie (Director: Yojiro TAKITA; starring: Kiichi NAKAI).

He actively worked first in the Shinchogumi (Tokugawa Shogunate guard organization) and later became a patriot of forces overthrowing the Shogunate. He was also a Kengo (great swordsman) of swordplay of the Hokushin-Ittoryu school. He was in the sixth squad of the Roshigumi (masterless warriors group), and his posts in the Shinchogumi were Teacher of swordsmanship (substituted teaching), kumigashira (head of the group), sponsorship, etc. After resigning from the Shinchogumi, he supported the movement of Sonno (Movement advocating reverence for the Emperor) and anti-Shogunate to contribute to the Meiji Restoration. Biography Birth Born in 1838 in Sadamitsu, Mima County, Awa Province. This is present Tsurugi Town, Mima County, Tokushima Prefecture. He was the second son of Kazo KASHIO, a retainer of the Hachisuka family (Matsudaira awa no kami). \\n (His brother was Motozaemon KASHIO.) Swordplay Dojo (training hall) He managed a swordplay dojo of the Hokushin-Ittoryu school in Sahara of Shimousa Province (present Sawara City, Chiba Prefecture). Some of his students later joined the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate). Sixth Squad, Roshigumi In 1863, he established &#8216;Roshigumi&#8217; with Hachiro KIYOKAWA, Tesshu YAMAOKA, Shungoro MURAKAMI, and Shuzo ISHIZAKA, who were the key persons of \\'Torao no kai,&#8217; a Sonno Joi kyushinha group (radical group of Sonno Joi, expulsion of foreigners). (Although Murakami and Kashio were both from Awa, were close friends since they were in Awa, both lived in Sahara, and belonged to the same swordsmanship school, the Hokushin-Ittoryu school, there is no record indicating that Kashio belonged to the Torao no kai.) The Roshigumi had an endorsement as a Joi group from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) as a result of the submission of the petition \\'three plans of urgent business&#8217; by Kiyokawa through Yamaoka in 1862. The bakufu&#8217;s intention was to establish \\'a convenient group with which they could collectively manage Sonno Joi and pro-Imperialist masterless warriors who threatened the public order.&#8217; This, however, was Kiyokawa&#8217;s trick to outsmart the bakufu to establish \\'a radical Sonno Joi group certified by the bakufu.&#8217; In February 1863, Kashio left Edo, together with Murakami (kumigashira) and the sixth squad of the Roshigumi, and went to Kyoto via the Nakasen-do Road. A radical Joi party from Mito including Kamo SERIZAWA and a Shieikan group of the Tennenrishin school including Isami KONDO, Toshizo HIJIKATA, Soji OKITA, and Shinpachi NAGAKURA joined them before their arrival at Mibu village, Kyoto (present Mibu, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture). Eminent people who later worked actively at the end of the Edo period joined the sixth squad of the Roshigumi. At Mibu village, Kashio, Murakami, and some others stayed at the Mibu village assembly office, and Serizawa, Kondo, and some others stayed at the Yagi Residence. This accommodation assignment had a significant impact on the split of the Roshigumi immediately thereafter. Kiyokawa&#8217;s official document of Sonno Joi, which surprised the bakufu, was accepted by the imperial court, and having received an imperial decree, the Roshigumi left Kyoto in March of that year and went to Edo. However, those who were members of the Roshigumi like Kashio and Murakami but protested against Kiyokawa&#8217;s action, which appeared to be betrayal of the bakufu, including Kondo, Serizawa, and others, mainly those staying at the Yagi Residence, and the Yuzan NEGISHI&#8217;s group decided to remain at Mibu Village to split from the Roshigumi. The members of the Roshigumi who remained at the Mibu village called themselves Mibu-Roshigumi, and later formed the Shinsengumi. \\n (Yuzan NEGISHI left the Mibu-Roshigumi to join the Shinchogumi when the Kondo group of the Shinsengumi started purging.) The bakufu was concerned that Kiyokawa would use the Roshigumi as a card for the Sonno and anti-shogunate movement, and sent assassins, including Tadasaburo SASAKI, in April of that year to murder Kiyokawa at Ichinohashi, Azabu. Before and after the murder, many of the members of the Torao no kai, including Murakami and Ishizaka, were arrested, and the Roshigumi was dissolved. Shinchogumi, Teacher of Swordsmanship Immediately after the murder of Kiyokawa, the Roshigumi was reorganized by the bakufu as &#8220;Shinchogumi,&#8221; security guards of Edo City, changing its direction dynamically. The headquaters was at Edo honjo (Sumida Ward) (present Honjo, Sumida Ward, Tokyo (Sumida Ward)). In 1864, it was placed under the custody of Shonai clan. Kashio&#8217;s talent was recognized in a geki-ken (swordsmanship) match, and he was appointed a teacher of swordsmanship of the Shinchogumi. He trained the members as a substitute for Kanji YAMADA, who was a head teacher of swordsmanship of the Shinchogumi and a senior apprentice of Hokushin-Ittoryu school, and also led the members as kumigashira and worked to guard Edo City. However, he suffered Rogai (tuberculosis), and sometimes coughed up blood. Resignation from the Shinchogumi - as a patriot of the restoration When the influence of the Shonai clan on the Shinchogumi increased and the characteristics of the Shinchogumi as a sabaku group (supportive group for the bakufu) became stronger, he left the Shinchogumi. Before and after his leaving, not only kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) groups but also Sonno and anti-shogunate groups contacted Kashio, and as a patriot he became more widely devoted to the restoration. He was intimate with Kaishu KATSU of the bakufu and Ryoma SAKAMOTO of Kaientai (an association of roshi organized by Ryoma SAKAMOTO) (Roshi association). Returning Home He returned to Awa (Sadamitsu, Mima County) in his later years for curing. Even after returning home, he harbored Sonno, anti-shogunate, pro-Imperialist samurai in his residence, and his attitude to contribute to the restoration did not change until the last minute of his life. Died on April 30, 1868. His life ended when the modern days started. Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name): &#27494;&#22533;&#38498; &#32681;&#31168;&#21213;&#36960;&#26085;&#34892;&#23621;&#22763;. His graveyard was in the Kashio family&#8217;s cemetery in his hometown, Sadamitsu, Tsurugi-machi, Mima County, Tokushima Prefecture. \\n (The graveyard is now in Tokushima City.) After his death, his father Kazo recommended Umanosuke&#8217;s wife, who was a close blood relative of Shusaku CHIBA, a swordsman of Kodachijutsu (swordmanship of kodachi, a small sword) of Hokushin-Ittoryu school, to return to her family&#8217;s home in Chiba. When leaving to return home, she left in the Kashio family a short sword that she had brought from the Chiba family. Others Family Crest His family crest was maru ni mitsukashiwa (Three oak leaves in a circle). Name He sometimes used \\'&#26575;&#23614;&#21491;&#39340;&#20043;&#21161;&#8217; and \\'&#26575;&#23614;&#21491;&#39340;&#21161;,&#8217; but \\'&#26575;&#23614;&#39340;&#20043;&#21161;&#8217; is written on his tombstone and in the family trees. Ichiro KASHIO, who was a member of the late Shinsengumi, is a different person. Photograph His photograph is maintained by the descendants of the Kashio family. Skinny, right-handed. East and West (Shinchogumi and Shinsengumi) Umanosuke KASHIO, who was a teacher of swordsmanship in the Shinchogumi, and Soji OKITA, who was a grand master of Gekken martial art in the Shinsengumi Although their late-life beliefs were completely different, restoration (Kashio) and supporting bakufu (Okita), they were both genius expert swordsmen and teachers or masters at young ages. Suffered Rogai (tuberculosis) and died young. They both died in 1868, having many similarities.

He was the leader of the Rikuentai, an army formed during the last days of Tokugawa shogunate. His original name was Koji, and then later changed to Michimasa.

Biography He was born in Kashiwagi Village, Kitagawa-go, Aki County, Tosa Province (present-day Kashiwagi, Kitagawa-mura, Aki-gun (Tosa Prefecture), Tosa Prefecture) as the first son of Kodenji NAKAOKA, headman of Kitagawago Village, and Hatsu NAKAOKA. He entered a martial arts training school run by Zuizan TAKEICHI (also known as Hanbeita). In 1861, he joined the Tosaginno Party that TAKEICHI had formed, taking an active part in its political activities. In 1862, he visited Shozan SAKUMA at Matsushiro with Gensui KUSAKA and Tamaki SHISHIDO, who were both of outstanding ability from Choshu clan, where they discussed national defense and political reform, which heightened their motivation for political activity. In 1863, with the start of a big crackdown on the Sonno Joi (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) movement in Tosa domain that followed the August 18 Incident (which falls on September 30 in the Gregorian calendar) in Kyoto, he quickly escaped the domain and in October of the same year, he sought refuge in Mitajiri, Choshu domain (now Hofu City). Thereafter, he became the leader of samurai who sought refuge in Choshu. He became a guard in the service of Sanetomi SANJO, who was one of the seven court nobles who was deported to Mitajiri from Kyoto, and acted as an important liaison between restoration activists in Choshu and those spread throughout Japan. In 1864, he went to Kyoto under the name of Seinosuke ISHIKAWA. He schemed to assassinate Hisamitsu SHIMAZU of Satsuma clan, which failed, and he also led his followers in the Kinmon Incident and the Shimonoseki War as the Choshu side, where he was wounded. Knowing that false charges were being brought against Choshu clan, witnessing the hostility between the major clans that was causing more harm than good, and seeing the suppression of the restoration activists, Shintaro changed from acting to protect the Emperor and exile barbarians to actively working to overthrow the shogunate by force (according to a letter written by Shintaro NAKAOKA at about this time). Thereafter, his priority became forming an alliance between Satsuma and Choshu and he arranged a meeting between Kogoro KATSURA (also known as Takayoshi KIDO) of Choshu and Takamori SAIGO of Satsuma. Shintaro maintained contact with Sanetomi SANJO and actively served as a liaison to all the exiles from Satsuma and Choshu, involving Ryoma SAKAMOTO of Kaientai (a group of leaderless warriors) and Kusuzaemon HIJIKATA (also known as Hisamoto HIJIKATA), who served as Sanjo&#8217;s guard. On March 7, 1866 (or March 8), he was able to lead the two clans to a reconciliation and finalized the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu at the Satsuma residence in Nihonmatsu, Kyoto. In March of 1867, the charge against him and Ryoma SAKAMOTO of fleeing Tosa domain was dropped. Later, he engaged in forging an alliance between Satsuma and Tosa, starting with successfully forming a secret pact between Taisuke INUI (also known as Taisuke ITAGAKI) of Tosa and Tatewaki KOMATSU and Kichinosuke SAIGO of Satsuma on June 23. Furthermore, he continued to work to win over Tosa clan in earnest. And, on July 23, at &#8216;Yoshidaya,&#8217; a restaurant in Sanbongi, Kyoto, a pact was formed to overthrow the shogunate and restore imperial rule; the parties to the pact were Tatewaki KOMATSU, Ichizo OKUBO (also known as Toshimichi OKUBO), Kichinosuke SAIGO of Satsuma, and Sazen TERAMURA, Shojiro GOTO, Taisuke INUI, Toji FUKUOKA (also known as Takachika FUKUOKA), Seinosuke ISHIKAWA (NAKAOKA) and Umetaro SAITANI (also known as Ryoma SAKAMOTO). On July 27 of the same year, the pact between Satsuma and Tosa was expanded to include Aki, which was a neighboring domain of Choshu, further strengthening ties among major clans. However, at that time, the Tosa and Aki clans themselves tried to petition the Tokugawa Shogunate for the return of the Emperor&#8217;s power; furthermore, Yodo YAMAUCHI still strongly felt indebted to the head of the Tokugawa family. Until the;ead pf Satsuma and Choshu forces became apparent in the Toba-Fushimi War that took place in January of the following year, these alliances between Satsuma and Tosa, and Satsuma, Tosa and Aki, were not able to exercise power. These military alliances, formed through the efforts of Shintaro and Ryoma, led to the opportunity to reform the old military system in Tosa clan, allowing Tosa to become a major power, one equivalent to Satsuma, Choshu and Hizen during the Boshin War. At the same time, the alliances accelerated a rise in the awareness of the part that the domains needed to play to change the feudal and shogunate systems, and the need to draw up a government vision for after the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate. To move ahead with the plan, Tosa was placed in a position to lead through the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate and enter the Meiji period with power equivalent to Satsuma, Choshu and Hizen. In July, he began to organize the Rikuentai, learning from the Kiheitai system in Choshu that he had been closely observing. He became the head of the Rikuentai and established its headquarters at the Shirakawa Tosa clan residence. At about this time, he wrote &#8220;Jiseiron,&#8221; an explanation of anti-Shogunate and anti-foreigner theory. On December 10, Shintaro was attacked and received a near-fatal injury when he was visiting Ryoma SAKAMOTO at Omiya in Kyoto. Ryoma died instantly (or early the following day), and Shintaro lived for two more days. He gave Tateki TANI a detailed account of the assassins&#8217; attack before succumbing on December 12. He was 29 years old. He was buried at the Kyoto-Ryozan-Gokoku-Jinja Shrine in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. A bronze statue of him stands at Muroto-misaki Cape. This statue is said to be facing Ryoma SAKAMOTO&#8217;s statue in Katsurahama. Others \\nIn the Tosa clan, village headsmen were transferred around, and so the Nakaoka family&#8217;s roots are not in Muroto. The Nakaoka family was part of the Fujiwara clan, and the family crest is a cotton flower in a circle. The Nakaoka Shintaro Memorial Museum was established at his birthplace, Kashiwagi, Kitagawa-mura, Aki-gun, Kochi Prefecture. The museum is approximately 20 minutes from Nahari Station on the Tosa-Kuroshio Railway&#8217;s Asa Line by Kitagawa Village-operated bus. Shintaro and Ryoma SAKAMOTO were attacked together at Omiya; however Shintaro lived for two days after the attack and said of the attack that the assassins shouted \\'Konakuso&#8217; (meaning &#8220;Damn you&#8221; in Iyo dialect). It seems he said he wanted to eat fried rice. His last words were; \\'That which may seem vulgar today may be precious tomorrow. \\n The potential to be a man of little consequences or to become a man of virtue lies in the mind of each man.&#8217; There are many novels and TV dramas about the Satsuma-Choshu alliance, the Satsuma-Tosa pact, and the return of political power to the Emperor by the Tokugawa Shogunate with an emphasis on Ryoma SAKAMOTO; however, there is debate as to who the central person in these events was. Some historians think it was Nakaoka. It remains unclear as to how much of Ryoma&#8217;s western legislative ideology Nakaoka agreed with. In a book entitled \\'JAPAN&#8217; that was published to introduce Japan in the US in 2000, Nakaoka&#8217;s statue in Muroto is mistakenly labeled as Ryoma SAKAMOTO&#8217;s.

He led the Kyoto prefectural government at its initial phase as a local official as well as a politician after Meiji Restoration. He is also known as a person who offered his demesne at the present-day Imadegawa Campus of Doshisha University to cooperate with Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA) who founded Doshisha English School (present-day Doshisha University). The period as a warrior He was born at a samurai residence near the Wakamatsu-jo Castle as the oldest son of Gonpachi YAMAMOTO who served as a gunnery instructor in the Aizu Domain. The forefather of the Yamamoto family is Kansuke YAMAMOTO, who was a scholar of military science of the Takeda clan. His family served the domain in the field of military science for generations. The name of his mother is Saku. Giei is his childhood name, and Yoshiharu his Imina (personal name). He recited a Gogonzekku (a poem of four lines, each of five (Chinese) characters) of Toshisen (Selection of Tang Poems, late 16th century) when he was four years old, and he distinguished himself when he learned at Hanko Nisshinkan (a school of the Aizu Domain). He moved to Edo and entered a school of Shozan SAKUMA together with Ayasaburo TAKEDA and Kaishu KATSU when he was 22 years old. He obtained the initiation of archery, horsemanship, spearsmanship and swordsmanship, and received the prize from the lord of the clan when he was around 23 years old. He moved again to Edo at the age of 25, and studied Dutch from, Chujo OKI (&#22823;&#26408;&#34935;&#22478;) as well as enhanced the research of foreign gunnery. He returned to the Aizu Domain and became a professor of the Nisshinkan school when he was 28 years old, and then opened a place for Dutch studies and served as the professor, but he was placed in confinement for one year because he criticized the old-guard crony. However, because he appealed for the necessity of the military system reformation to carry out his original intention, he was selected as a Gunji torishirabe yaku (a person in charge of investigation of military affairs) and a Taiho todori (a leader of cannon) at the same time. In 1862, he followed the lord of the clan, Katamori MATSUDAIRA, who was appointed as Kyoto shugoshoku (Military governor of Kyoto), to Kyoto, and trained the Western-style troops at the headquarters in Konkai Komyo-ji Temple as well as supervised Yogakusho (Institute of Foreign Study) to give the Western study lectures to retainers from various domains in Kyoto. He distinguished himself during Kinmon Incident in 1864, in which he participated with gun crews, therefore he was appointed as a Koyonin. Due to this appointment, he had more chances to see the important persons from the shogunate and various domains, and broadened his activity scope, however unfortunately he lost eyesight due to an eye disease. \\n (There are some theories for his blindness, such as that he suffered damage due to a broken piece during Kinmon Incident, and that his chronic disease of cataract was worsened) \\nHowever, he did not give up hope; he took charge of an orphaned child of Shozan, who was assassinated, at the request of Katsu, and broadened the Western knowledge from Amane NISHI (a torchbearer) who was introduced to him by Katsu. (Kakuma issued Nishi&#8217;s major work &#8220;Hyakuichi Shinron&#8221; [The New Theory of the Hundred and One] later). He stayed in Kyoto during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868, and was captured by the Satsuma clan and taken to the residence of Satsuma Domain, however the top leaders of the Satsuma clan did not kick him around because they knew his excellence. He wrote a petition &#8216;Kanken&#8217; (the house diary of the Saionji family) by dictation during this confinement and submitted it to the lord of the clan. When Takamori SAIGO and others read this, they admired him even more, and treated him all the more respectfully. He was moved to a hospital in the residence of Sendai Domain in 1868, where he met Tomomi IWAKURA, and then he was released next year. What is &#8220;Kanken&#8221; Kanken&#8217; is a petition addressed to the new government (addressed to Oyakusho) in July, 1868, in which Kakuma argued about the ideal situation of Japan in 22 different areas such as politics, economics and education. He called this petition as his own view (\\'Kanken&#8217;) with modesty. His petition is remarkably similar to \\'Kokuze Sanron&#8217; (the Three Major Discussion of State Policy), which a thinker Shonan YOKOI advocated to stress the importance of establishing Fukoku (fortifying the country), Kyohei (strengthening the military) and Shido (morality of samurai) (economics, national defense and ethics), however Kakuma further advanced his idea. His petition dealt with a wide range of matters: \\'Constitution,&#8217; i.e. the separation of the administrative, legislative, and judiciary branches of government; \\'Giji-in&#8217; (Diet), i.e. having a bicameral parliament with a lower and upper house; \\'Schools&#8217;; \\'System reform&#8217;; \\'National polity,&#8217; i.e. the shift from the feudal system to the county/prefecture system, abolishment of the hereditary system, and tax system reform; \\'Nation building techniques&#8217;; \\'Iron and steel production&#8217;; \\'Currency&#8217;; \\'Food and clothing&#8217;; \\'Education for women&#8217; that promoted the education of girls; \\'Heikin-ho&#8217; (averaging method), i.e. the average distribution of property; \\'Brewing methods&#8217;; \\'Treaties&#8217;; \\'National warship program&#8217;; \\'Harbor regulations&#8217;; \\'Citizen welfare&#8217;; \\'Laws concerning hair&#8217;; \\'Henbutsu-ho&#8217; (laws concerning temples), i.e. the opening up of temple schools to the public; \\'Shoritsu&#8217; (commercial laws); \\'Jiho&#8217; (timetable method); \\'Rekiho&#8217; (method of making calendars), i.e. the promotion of the adoption of the solar calendar; and \\'Kani&#8217; (office doctor), i.e. the promotion of the adoption of Western medical science. This contained a full of excellent foresight and his idea also led to the framework of the new Meiji government strategies. The period of politics After being set free, Kakuma served in Kyoto Prefectural Government thanks to the recommendation of Sakuma KAWADA, a Daisanji (second to a governor) of Kyoto Prefecture, and led the Kyoto government as an adviser of Masanao MAKIMURA (who later became the governor by Order of Kyoto Prefecture) who was taking the helm of the Kyoto government as a Gon Daisanji (second to a governor). Also he gave lectures on politics and economics at home (the students at that time were such as Michiyuki MATSUDA who later became the governor of Shiga Prefecture and Tokyo Prefecture, and Shiro FUJIMURA who later became the governor of Osaka Prefecture), and also promoted the industrialization policy of the initial prefectural government under Makimura and made great contribution to the modernization of Kyoto. He organized the first \\'Exhibition&#8217; in Japan and also wrote the guidebook in English, which was the first guide written in English. He got lamish around this time. The period of religious belief In Spring, he identified with &#8220;Tiandao suyuan&#8221; (Evidence for Christianity) given by a missionary doctor, Gordon (U.S.) who was engaged in mission work in Osaka at that time. He believed that Christianity can truly polish the heart of Japanese people and help promote their advancement. At that time, he met Joe NIIJIMA (who later married with his younger sister Yae NIIZIMA) and promised that he would cooperate with him when he came to know his plan to establish a school. Kakuma handed over his site (6000 Tsubo [unit of land measurement; 3.95 square yards; 3.31 square meters]) of the former Satsuma Domain residence, which he bought after Meiji Restoration, to Niijima to build a school. And then, he submitted \\'Shigaku kaigyo negai&#8217; (request for opening private [non-governmental] school [college, university]) to Ministry of Education in the joint names of Niijima and Kakuma, which was later approved. This school site was succeeded by the later established Doshisha English School and its successor Doshisha University, and is used as Imadegawa Campus at present (\\'Doshisha&#8217; is said to have been named by Kakuma). Two years after he was relieved from the duty as an adviser, he was elected to be as a representative of the prefectural government by obtaining 51 votes in Kamigyo Ward during the first election. He became one of the first Kyoto prefectural representatives, and also the first chairman. He resigned both his position as chairman and his membership next year, and then was engaged mainly in the operation of Doshisha. He became the chairman of the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and got baptized together with his wife Tokie in the same year. Niijima passed away. Kakuma contributed to the development of Doshisha as the temporary president of Doshisha. He died at the age of 64 in 1892. He was raised to Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank). His grave is in Hachioji. Family \\nHis parents had three sons and three daughters, but one son and two daughters died when small. Kakuma married with Ura in Aizu when he was around 29 years old. His oldest daughter died when small, and his second daughter was born in 1862. He went up to Kyoto at that time. His younger sister Yae and Shonosuke KAWASAKI (who was a Western scholar and a son of the doctor of the Izushi Domain in Tajima Province, who was invited to the place for Dutch studies as a professor) got married in 1865. His younger brother Saburo died during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and the other family members were held up in Tsuruga-jo Castle, but his father Gonpachi died on the battle field outside the castle. After separated from Shonosuke, Yae fearlessly fought saying \\'Gun more than sewing,&#8217; but finally surrendered the castle after engraving a poem \\'Who would see the moon in my familiar sky tomorrow night?&#8217; on the castle wall using a Kanzashi (an ornamental hairpin). Kakuma bought a residence in Kyoto with the size of 100 Tsubo (unit of land measurement; 3.95 square yards; 3.31 square meters) from Tatsugoro SHINMON (a fire brigade in the later Edo period and the head of professional gamblers, who came to know Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI in Ueno and whose daughter became a concubine of Yoshinobu) at the price of 36 yen, and lived there (the monthly salary of Kakuma at that time is 45 yen). His second daughter, Hisae was born in 1870. The next year his mother Saku (who later served as a Shakan (a dormitory dean) of Doshisha Girls&#8217; School), Yae and Mine went up to Kyoto and lived together with him. Ura stayed in Aizu asking for divorce. In the same year he married with Tokie who had been providing his personal care. Yae learned such as English because she had a good foresight, and was called a Christian lady due to her Western clothes and hair style after baptized and married with Niijima. Saku and Mine got baptized in the same year. Mine married with Tokio YOKOI (the oldest son of a Confucian scholar Shonan YOKOI and the third president of Doshisha) in 1881. Tokio was a maternal cousin of Roka TOKUTOMI (real name: Kenjiro), who wrote a novel \\'Kuroi me to chairo no me&#8217; (Black Eyes and Brown Eyes) describing his conflicted love affair with Hisae. After bearing the oldest son named Heima (&#24179;&#39340;), Mine died at the age of 24, and Heima (&#24179;&#39340;) was adopted to be the heir of the Yamamoto family. The engagement of Hisae and Roka was broken off in the same year. Niijima died in Oiso in 1890, and Kakuma died at home two years later. Hisae died due to an illness at the age of 23 in 1893, and Saku died at the age of 85 in 1896, who lived the longest of the family (Yae died at the age of 85). He detested ostentation in society, and held the idea of \\'cutting one&#8217;s coat according to one&#8217;s cloth&#8217; to be of the greatest importance.
